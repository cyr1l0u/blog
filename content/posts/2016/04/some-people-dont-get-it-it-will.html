<p>Call it experience or exposure to a larger dataset. Anything you build will <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/if-something-can-fail-it-will.html">eventually fail</a>; just because you haven&#x2019;t experienced the failure yet doesn&#x2019;t mean that the system will never fail but only that you were lucky so far.<!--more--></p>
<p>Let me use a trivial example from real world to illustrate the point. When I was a kid, we didn&#x2019;t use seat belts, because everyone knew that a traffic accident couldn&#x2019;t possibly happen to him (or his dad/mom). When I was a teenager, I was fortunate enough to use a seat belt (even though it wasn&#x2019;t common), or I wouldn&#x2019;t be writing this blog post.</p>
<p>The whole <em>stretched whatever </em>debate is really a question of <em>risk management</em> and balancing <em>convenience </em>(in Mark&#x2019;s case the management burden) against inevitable crash. The two real questions to consider are &ldquo;<em>How often does that happen?</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>What happens after the failure?</em>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;<em>How much will a failure cost me?</em>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people promoting next-big-thingy don&#x2019;t consider the risks involved and never go through the exercise of identifying all possible failure scenarios and their consequences, and all I&#x2019;m trying to do is to point out that <em>there&#x2019;s non-zero risk </em>and that <em>the consequences could be fatal.</em></p>
<p>However, once you went through the above exercise, and understand all the implications of what you&#x2019;re doing, go ahead and choose the option that makes most sense to you; we&#x2019;ll explore quite a few of them during the design sessions in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center online course</a>.</p>
