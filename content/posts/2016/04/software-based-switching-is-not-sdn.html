<p>Russ White made an excellent remark while <a href="http://ntwrk.guru/reaction-650-gbs-software-router/">discussing the news</a> that the CloudRouter pushed 650 Gbps through commodity hardware: &ldquo;<em>If this is software defined networking, then we&#x2019;ve been doing this since sometime in the 1990&#x2019;s, perhaps even earlier&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s absolutely right &ndash; the first routers (like AGS or IGS from Cisco) did all packet forwarding in software, so as I explained during the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN101">Introduction to SDN</a> webinar while reaching dozens of gigabits with software-based packet forwarding is exciting, <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/2.2 - Software-Based Packet Forwarding.mp4">calling it SDN doesn&#x2019;t make much sense</a>.</p>
