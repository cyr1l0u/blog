<p>After I told you that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/sad-news-im-not-coming-to-interop-las.html">I&#x2019;m not going to Interop</a>, I got numerous emails along the lines of &ldquo;<em>but I was really looking forward to attending your workshop</em>&rdquo; so I started looking for a solution that would combine the best of online and classroom worlds.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s my first attempt: an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">interactive online course</a> combining topics from two of my Interop workshops. I&#x2019;m still working on the detailed agenda and plan to have it ready around May 1<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">st</span>. In the meantime, I&#x2019;d really appreciate your feedback &ndash; leave a comment or send me an email.</p>
