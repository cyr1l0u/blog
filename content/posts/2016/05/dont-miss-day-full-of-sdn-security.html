<p>Gabi Gerber (with a bit of help from my side) is organizing another set of SDN events in Zurich (Switzerland) in early June.</p>
<p>In the <strong>morning of June 7</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span> we&#x2019;ll talk about <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">software-defined security</a>:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I&#x2019;ll quickly walk you through various solutions &ndash; from things that run in production to those that better stay in PowerPoint;</li>
<li>Sergei Gotchev from Juniper will talk about data center automation and their SDN/security solutions;</li>
<li>After the break we&#x2019;ll spend at least 2 hours talking about your challenges&hellip; and anything goes as long as it&#x2019;s loosely related to SDN and security &ndash; from &ldquo;<em>should I use NSX or ACI for microsegmentation?</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>does service insertion make sense?</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>how do I roll this out in my organization?</em>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>afternoon of June 7</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span> is focused on <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-event/">microsegmentation and NSX</a>:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I&#x2019;ll start with a quick introduction to what microsegmentation is, whether it makes sense, and what its benefits and drawbacks are;</li>
<li>Mitja Robas, a good friend of mine and an awesome networking architect, will talk about his NSX implementation experience (he has NSX running in a production deployment). There&#x2019;s an interesting story around how that deployment started, and you might hear it if you&#x2019;ll stay for the after-event apero;</li>
<li>Thomas Wacker from UBS will talk about reducing data center complexity;</li>
<li>Finally, Christof Jungo will focus on a topic many vendors don&#x2019;t really want to see mentioned: how do you secure an SDN network.</li>
</ul>
