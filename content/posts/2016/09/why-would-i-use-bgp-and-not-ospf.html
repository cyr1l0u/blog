<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>While we were preparing for the Cumulus Networks&#x2019; <a href="https://vimeo.com/171631723">Routing on Hosts</a> webinar <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt">Dinesh Dutt</a> sent me a message along these lines:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">You categorically reject the use of OSPF, but we have a couple of customers using it quite happily. I'm sure you have <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/virtual-appliance-routing-network.html">good reasons</a> and the reasons you list [in the presentation] are ones I agree with. OTOH, why not use totally stubby areas with the hosts being in such an area?</blockquote>
<p>How about:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Because OSPF stub areas would be a total mess to configure?</strong> Hmm&hellip; maybe not really, we could make it reasonably easy, particularly with network automation.</p>
<p><strong>One host going crazy would impact at least all other hosts in the same area</strong>. Definitely not as bad as running servers in backbone area but still. Maybe it&#x2019;s not so relevant if you&#x2019;re running the same version of Quagga (for example, Cumulus-enhanced Quagga) on both ends.</p>
<p><strong>Because you couldn&#x2019;t filter the prefixes announced by the host?</strong> Well, you could control the summarization of prefixes from totally stubby area into backbone area (in theory, not sure many vendors actually implemented that), but within the area you&#x2019;d still trust everyone. That might not be a problem if you control all the hosts, but would be a huge deal if you don&#x2019;t&hellip; and it would be a nirvana for any intruder trying to move laterally.</p>
<p><strong>Because you can&#x2019;t implement routing policies (like </strong><strong><em>no transit</em></strong><strong>) in OSPF?</strong> I&#x2019;ve seen designs where an IBM mainframe was a single link failure away from becoming a transit router.</p>
<p>Finally, server-to-network interface is usually a trust boundary, and <strong>I don&#x2019;t believe in running OSPF across trust boundaries</strong>. Maybe that&#x2019;s less of an issue if the same team controls the servers and the network, and runs the same routing software on both, but I definitely wouldn&#x2019;t run OSPF with just any software that happens to be lying around on a host.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#x2019;s just that <strong>I like BGP</strong> and keep inventing reasons why it&#x2019;s the best tool for the $job.</p>
