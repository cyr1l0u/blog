<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>My friend Robert Turnšek published an <a href="http://www.nil.com/en/knowledge/blog/so-you-want-to-become-a-cloud-provider/">interesting blog post pondering whether it makes sense to become a cloud provider</a>.</p>
<p>I loved reading it, particularly the <em>Trap for System Integrators </em>part, because I know a bit of the history, and could easily identify two or three failed or stalled projects per paragraph (like: “<em>Just adding some blade servers and storage to the existing server environment won’t make you a cloud provider</em>”). Hope you’ll have as much fun as I did.</p>
