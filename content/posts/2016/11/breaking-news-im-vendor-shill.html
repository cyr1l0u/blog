<p>Got this comment on my <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html">Network Automation RFP Requirements</a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Looks like you are paid shill for Brocade based on the quote earlier in your blog "The Pass/Fail information included below was collected to the best of my knowledge with extensive help from Jason Edelman, Nick Buraglio, David Barroso and several Brocade engineers (THANK YOU!)."</blockquote>
<p>Hooray, one more accolade to add to my <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/extremely-off-topic-another-recognition.html">list of accomplishments</a>. And now for a few more details:<!--more--></p>
<h4>The quote from the blog post</h4><p>When I started putting together the blog post I reached out to people who have more operational experience with certain gear than I do. If you follow them or listen to my podcast it&#x2019;s not hard to guess why I contacted Jason, Nick and David. </p>
<p>I also contacted few friends who happen to work at Brocade because:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Brocade made huge improvements to NOS network automation functionality in recent releases;</li>
<li>I wanted to check whether they&#x2019;re still missing as many functions as I remembered from the time I&#x2019;d been doing the Data Center Fabrics Update session.</li>
</ul>
<p class='note'>I&#x2019;m pretty positive I gained no friends @ Brocade with that blog post, and I still haven&#x2019;t received any money (or even tchotchke) from them, so I must be a virtual shill ;)</p>
<h4>Totally Irrelevant</h4><p>The real reason I contacted friends @ Brocade and not at $SomeOtherVendor is because I lost contact with many engineers I knew at $SomeOtherVendor.</p>
<p>Likewise, the real reason I <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/09/juniper-is-serious-about-openconfig-and.html">wrote about Juniper&#x2019;s OpenConfig support</a> when I did is because a friend who happen to be working at Juniper was kind enough to send me an email saying &ldquo;hey, this is now shipping&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the email came from a friend and not from their Product Marketing or Social Media Experts. The only contact I have with those people is when they complain after I write about <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/junos-fusion-fex-reinvented.html">their use</a> of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/marketing-grammar.html">marketing grammar</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I know I&#x2019;m usually missing some recently-shipped goodie and always fix my blog posts if someone points out my omissions. However, I got no information from $SomeOtherVendor saying &ldquo;<em>hey, you missed feature X shipping in version Y, here&#x2019;s the documentation URL</em>&rdquo; that would prompt me to update that particular blog post. You can see <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html?showComment=1477403406970#c1792883115184277297">most of what I got</a> on the original blog post.</p>
<p>Make your own conclusions.</p>
<h4>Back to topic</h4><p>While talking about vendor shills&hellip; you might have noticed that I stopped doing sponsored webinars, probably at least 2 years ago (too lazy to check). They were too much hassle (until you tried it, you have no idea how annoying it is to get registered as a $vendor&#x2019;s supplier), and I always had a bit of integrity problem &ndash; while I tried to stay as neutral as possible, it was hard to stay completely unbiased.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I invited numerous vendor engineers I trusted would focus on technology and not on vendor message to be presenters at my webinars. These engineers came from (in alphabetical order) Arista, Avaya, Cisco, Cumulus Networks, and Juniper.</p>
<p class="note">To be fully transparent: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsp42">David Gee</a> works at Brocade now, but he wasn&#x2019;t when we were doing the first NETCONF and YANG webinar, and he never talked about anything Brocade-specific.</p>
<p>I also invited vendor engineers to Software Gone Wild podcasts. They came from Avaya, Big Switch Networks, Cumulus Networks, Docker, Juniper, HP, Palo Alto and VMware (plus a few startups).</p>
<p>Guess who&#x2019;s missing? Yep, it&#x2019;s Brocade. Good job, dear Anonymous, you really did do a thorough fact checking before accusing me of being a shill. And BTW, making baseless anonymous accusations is a great way to start a conversation, particularly if you want to persuade someone to change his mind. Just saying&hellip;</p>
