<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> podcast is well into its toddler years and it was time for a <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_60-Software-Defined_Navel_Gazing.mp3">teambuilding exercise</a>. Just kidding &ndash; we wanted to test new tools and decided to discuss the vacation experiences and podcast ideas while doing that.</p>
<p>On a more serious note: we&rsquo;re always looking for cool projects, implementations and ideas. Contact us at podcast (-the weird sign-) ipspace.net.</p>
