<p>Long story short: I burned out <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/09/the-autumn-cloudsdn-roadtrip.html">last autumn</a> and still haven&#x2019;t recovered.</p>
<p>I managed to find a replacement instructor for three of my workshops, so I hope they&#x2019;ll still take place. I&#x2019;m also working on other ways of delivering them to whoever is interested in an interactive live session.</p>
<p>To all the people who wanted to meet me in Las Vegas: I&#x2019;m really sorry I&#x2019;ll miss you. Interop was always a great place for interesting conversations and awesome workshop audiences.</p>
