<p>Long story short: I burned out <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/09/the-autumn-cloudsdn-roadtrip.html">last autumn</a> and still haven’t recovered.</p>
<p>I managed to find a replacement instructor for three of my workshops, so I hope they’ll still take place. I’m also working on other ways of delivering them to whoever is interested in an interactive live session.</p>
<p>To all the people who wanted to meet me in Las Vegas: I’m really sorry I’ll miss you. Interop was always a great place for interesting conversations and awesome workshop audiences.</p>
