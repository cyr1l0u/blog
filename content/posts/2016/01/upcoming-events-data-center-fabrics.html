<p>Online webinars are great, but many engineers still <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/why-would-you-want-to-attend-classroom.html">prefer live workshops</a> &ndash; they&#x2019;re an excellent opportunity for unrestricted 2-way communication and exchange of ideas &ndash; so I decided to turn a few of my best webinars (or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinar_roadmaps">webinar tracks</a>) into workshops, and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/08/ch.linkedin.com/pub/gabi-gerber/6/b99/28">Gabi Gerber</a>, the wonderful organizer of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/09/see-you-in-bern-on-september-16th.html">Data Center days</a> in Switzerland took over the logistics, resulting in the first-ever <a href="http://www.digs.ch/digs-workshop-data-center-fabrics-overview/">Data Center Fabrics workshop in Zurich</a> in late March.<!--more--></p>
<p>As always, it&#x2019;s crucial to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be.html">get the fundamentals right</a>, so the live workshop includes the topics you need to get your vendor selection or planning process started, from requirements to common architectures. You&#x2019;ll also get access to the complete <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics webinar</a> (<a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric">over 12 hours of content</a>), which covers details of hardware and software architectures of all major data center switching vendors including Arista, Brocade, Cisco, Dell, HP and Juniper.</p>
