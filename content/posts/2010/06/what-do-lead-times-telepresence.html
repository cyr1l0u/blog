<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Amy, Ethan, Greg and Jeremy (in alphabetical order, just in case you wondered).</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Listen to the <a href="http://packetpushers.net/packet-pushers-podcast-8-something-on-the-light-side-part-1/">Packet Pushers Podcast (to be forever known as PPP) #8</a></p>
<p>Yesterday I decided to get some gym climbing after a long spell of bad weather and PPP#8 was ideal companion for the drive (driving and <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-7-hiding-in-plain-sight-enterprise-mpls/">listening to PPP#7 where those crazy guys were discussing Enterprise MPLS</a> might not be a good idea). They started with incredibly long lead times on popular boxes (nothing new if youâ€™ve been in the industry long enough, we had them when Cisco shipped the 4000-series routers in the previous millennium), jumped to Telepresence and IOS licensing ... and finished with the really important question whether you should encourage the geekiness in your kids; all together a nice medley of interesting topics.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note to Ethan:</strong> This is the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps10616/white_paper_c11_556985.html">best ISR G2 licensing document</a> I found so far. <br/><strong>Note to Cisco Marketing:</strong> You know you can do better than that. <br/><strong>Note to Cisco CA</strong> (or whoever owns this tool): <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/ITDIT/CFN/">Feature Navigator</a> is BROKEN (when applied to release 15.0) and thus useless to figure out which license I need for ISR G2.</p>
