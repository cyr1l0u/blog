<p>I’ve stumbled across a <a href="http://www.jeremyfilliben.com/2009/08/when-administrative-distance-doesnt.html">really interesting BGP/IGP problem described by Jeremy Filliben</a> that nicely illustrates the dangers of using more than one IGP in your network. You should read the original post for details, here’s a short summary:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The same IP prefix is received by two BGP border routers (A and D) and sent to a third IBGP-only router (E).</li>
<li>E can reach A via OSPF. It can reach D via EIGRP. </li>
<li>E receives two BGP paths to the target IP prefix from A and D. They are identical, so the IGP metric (taken from the IP routing table) is used as the tie-breaker.</li>
<li>EIGRP and OSPF metrics are totally incomparable and thus A (reachable via OSPF) is always preferred over D (reachable via EIGRP).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> use a single IGP in your AS (or at least in its BGP core).</p>
