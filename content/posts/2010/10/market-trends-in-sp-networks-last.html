<p>Just FYI: Wednesday <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks"><em>Market Trends in Service Provider Networks</em></a> webinar (<a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>) is the last session I’ll run in the Central European time zone; the interest from countries that would benefit most – East Asia and Pacific region – is minimal.</p>
