<p>Last gems found in dusty corners of my cluttered Inbox:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The Myths of IT – <a href="http://networktherapy.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/the-myths-of-it-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://networktherapy.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/the-myths-of-it-part-2/">Part 2</a>. A must-read for anyone working in the IT industry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staticnat.com/WP/2010/11/23/joshs-rules-on-selling-solutions/">Josh’s Rules on Selling Solutions</a>. Some of us work in sales-related jobs... which doesn’t mean you should not maintain your professional integrity.</li>
<li><a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/phone/">Phone</a> - Scott Adams (of the Dilbert fame) ranting about smartphones. Priceless.</li>
<li><a href="http://h30458.www3.hp.com/ww/en/smb/998493.html">How to learn more effectively</a> – good article, but why does it belong to “Small &amp; Medium Business Solutions” section on HP web site?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/07/cascading-needs/">Maybe you only need it because you have it</a> – seen it too many times. Might also apply to long-distance vMotion.</li>
<li><a href="http://mirrorshades.net/post/1485951163">The First Law of Systems Administration</a> – always have backups ... and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen">wear sunscreen</a>.</li>
</ul>
