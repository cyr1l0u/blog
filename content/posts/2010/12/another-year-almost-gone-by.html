<p>It’s hard to believe it’s another Christmas Eve, but obviously there must be some truth in the old wisdom that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122322542">time flies by as you get older</a>. I know some of you have holiday maintenance windows in the next days; I can only wish you hiccup-free experience. But regardless of what’s waiting for you in the near future, if the days around Christmas are a holiday season for you, don’t forget that it all started with a loving family having pretty hard times, not with the Three Wise Men going to a shopping mall to buy gifts.</p>
<p>I’ll try to follow my own advice for a change; you won’t find me on Twitter during the rest of the year and the only blog posts I’ll publish will be the yearly statistics. As this is the last “real” post in 2010, I would like to wish you Merry Christmas and a fantastic 2011 (where <em>fantastic </em>includes <em>happy, successful, healthy, </em>and everything else you want it to be).</p>
