<p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png" class="ImgFLTright"></a>When I was testing EEM SNMP integration, I wanted to decode the SNMP traps sent by the router with Wireshark. Wireshark performed wonderfully, but could not decode the Cisco-specific object IDs used in the traps. I knew I had to download Cisco-specific MIB files and install them in Wireshark, but doing that proved a bit harder than expected … and the Wireshark and NetSNMP documentation was not too helpful.</p>
<p class="more">EEM-SNMP integration is described in the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Embedded_Event_Manager_(EEM)_Workshop"><span>Embedded Event Manager (EEM) workshop</span></a>. You can attend an <a href="http://ioshints.eventbrite.com/">online version of the workshop</a>; we can also organize a dedicated event for your networking team.</p>
<p>You can find the final results of my struggles in the “<a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Add_MIB_files_to_Wireshark_SNMP_decoder">Add MIB files to Wireshark SNMP decoder</a>” article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
