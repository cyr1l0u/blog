<p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>Almost all articles describing DMVPN in combination with OSPF use the “magic” <strong>ip ospf database-filter all out </strong>command on the hub routers to minimize the OSPF traffic traversing the DMVPN part of the network.</p>
<p class="info">The same trick can be used in any hub-and-spoke network, including Frame Relay-based networks.</p>
<p>What these articles usually fail to tell you is the true impact of this command: it stops all OSPF flooding from hub router. The spoke routers receive no OSPF information whatsoever; to establish connectivity to the network core, you have to use static default routes on the <del class="wrong">hub</del><ins class="corr">spoke</ins> routers. </p>
<p>I’ve described the details of OSPF flooding filters and their use in hub-and-spoke networks in the “<a href="http://wiki.nil.com/OSPF_flooding_filters_in_hub-and-spoke_environment">OSPF flooding filters in hub-and-spoke environment</a>” article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
