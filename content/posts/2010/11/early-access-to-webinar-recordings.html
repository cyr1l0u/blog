<p>I get a question along these lines at least once a week: “<em>I would love to register for your webinar, but it’s too late for me. I need the information sooner than that.</em>”</p>
<p>My usual response was: “<em>Don’t worry, just register and let me know you’d like to get access to the materials &amp; recordings.</em>” and I would then send a URL to a prior Webex recording and a PDF file to the attendee.</p>
<p>Recently I rolled out <em>webinar management system </em>to build the infrastructure for another exciting project (more about that in a week or so) and one of the nice side effects is that you get access to past materials (automatically, without the need to ask me) right after the registration: half an hour after placing the order with Eventbrite, you can access the webinar materials and view Webex recordings of all past sessions.</p>
<!--more--><p>The <em>webinar management system </em>has also solved another interesting problem: I’ve always promised attendees of past sessions unlimited access to new recordings and materials ... but yet again they had to ask or I had to send them URLs to the new additions. All this is gone: whenever you log in, you’ll see the latest versions of materials and recordings for all the webinars you’ve ever registered for.</p>
