<p>The networking department at one of the leading US universities got a great idea last year: they were organizing a summer networking bootcamp for undergraduate students and decided to use some of my webinars as background/supplementary material. As we've been working with Central European universities for over a decade, we were able to add yet another product to the mix: <a href="http://stack.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/IPPRe">IP Primer</a> (introduction to TCP/IP) which includes <a href="http://stack.nil.si/C1256F0A0048C79A/html/IP_Primer_Desc">hands-on exercises on live Cisco IOS routers</a>.</p>
<p>Their idea was obviously pretty successful â€“ they'll do the same thing this year. Would you like to do something similar? <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/contact?StySu=Summer+Bootcamp">Contact me</a>, tell me more about your project, and I'm positive we'll find a way to help you.</p>
