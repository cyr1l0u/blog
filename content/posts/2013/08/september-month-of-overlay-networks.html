<p>September definitely seems to be the month of overlay networks (at least from my perspective). The fun starts on September 4<sup>th</sup> with the <a href="http://overlaynetworks-blog.eventbrite.com/">Overlay Virtual Networking</a> webinar which will describe overlay networking solutions from (in alphabetical order) Cisco, Microsoft, Midokura, OpenStack, VMware, and whichever startup sends me product documentation of a shipping product in the next two weeks.<!--more--></p>
<p>Next on the list: <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/sddc-symposium/">Software Defined Data Center</a> symposium and <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/">Networking Tech Field Day 6</a>. We’ll definitely talk about overlay networks during both events.</p>
<p>A few days after Networking Tech Field Day: <a href="http://nsx-blog.eventbrite.com/">VMware NSX Architecture</a> webinar. It’s sponsored by VMware and therefore free and the tickets are rapidly disappearing, so make sure you register ASAP.</p>
<p>In the same week: a joint NIL-Microsoft event where I’ll talk about Hyper-V Network Virtualization and PowerShell automation. You’d have to come to Slovenia to participate in that one.</p>
<p>There might be one other event at the very end of September. More about that one once it’s confirmed.</p>
<p>Finally, a message to both readers from Italy: I’ll be in Rome in October running <a href="http://www.reissromoli.it/index.php/seminario-internazionale-cloud-computing-networking.html">Cloud Computing Networking</a> seminar organized by <a href="http://www.reissromoli.it/">Reiss Romoli</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>
