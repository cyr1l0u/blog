<p>More than 15 years ago the cover story of <a href="http://networker.acm.org/">ACM netWorker</a> magazine discussed the <a href="http://www.isen.com/papers/Dawnstupid.html">dawn of the stupid network</a> – an architecture with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html">smart edge nodes and simple packet forwarding code</a>. Obviously we learned nothing in all those years – we’re <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/network-virtualization-and-spaghetti.html">still having the same discussions</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few juicy quotes from that article (taken completely out of context solely for your enjoyment).<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">The telcos seemed to "fall asleep at the switch" at the core of their network.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">"Keep it simple, stupid," or KISS, is an engineering virtue. The Intelligent Network, however, is anything but simple; it is a marketing concept for scarce, complicated, high-priced services.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">The Intelligent Network impedes innovation. Existing features are integrally spaghetti-coded into the guts of the network, and new features must intertwine with the old.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Infrastructure improvements are rapidly making the telcos' Intelligent Network a distinctly second-rate choice. The bottom line, though, is not the infrastructure; it is the innovation that the Stupid Network unleashes.</blockquote>
<p>The whole article is well worth reading, more so considering it’s over 15 years old and still spot-on.</p>
