<p class='update'>Update 2013-07-30 13:30 GMT - domain switched over, everything should be back to normal within an hour.</p>
<p>In the next 24 hours (to make sure all high-TTL DNS records expire) I'll migrate blog.ioshints.info to blog.ipspace.net. The old domain will remain active with permanent redirects to the new domain so you shouldn't have to change anything on your end. However, if you experience any problems access the blog or the main web site (www.ipspace.net) please let me know. Thank you!</p>
