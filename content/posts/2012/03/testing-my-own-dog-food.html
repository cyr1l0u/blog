<p>I decided it was high time to start using some of the cloud services I'm writing about in production. Haven't jumped into EC2 yet, but the DNS server for ioshints.info has been moved to Amazon Route 53 and the static parts of the blog are served from Amazon S3.</p>
<p>This should result in somewhat faster web site for my largest audience - US readers. Next step: CloudFront. And as always - if you find something is broken, please write a comment or contact me directly.</p>
