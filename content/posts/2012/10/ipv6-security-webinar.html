<p>Not surprisingly, IPv6 has almost the same set of security problems as IPv4. Even worse, some of the things we’ve already solved in IPv4 (fragmented TCP/UDP headers) haven’t been ported to IPv6, and implementations of IPv6 security features lag far behind their IPv4 counterparts. </p>
<p>The upcoming <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6Sec">IPv6 security</a> webinar (<a href="http://ipv6security.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>) describes these problems, and I managed to get the best possible guest speaker: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/evyncke">Eric Vyncke</a> (the author of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587055945/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1587055945&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20">IPv6 Security Cisco Press</a> book) will tell you all about the IPv6 security features available in Cisco IOS.</p>
