<p>Most interesting article in this batch: <a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2012/01/ethernet-taps-dont-get-me-started.html">Ethernet Taps - Don't Get Me Started</a> by Chris Marget, focusing on Ethernet taps: passive, active, aggregators, L1 switches ...</p>
<p>And here are the other interesting links I found in somewhat random order:<!--more--></p>
<h4>Data Center</h4><p><a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2012/01/future-openflowsdn-applications.html">Possibilities of OpenFlow/SDN Applications</a>: Jason listed five very interesting applications that could benefit from OpenFlow/SDN. The gotcha - having per-flow state anywhere close to the network    core will never scale.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://eos.aristanetworks.com/2012/01/email-alerts/">Email Alerts on Interface State Changes</a>: Arista's EOS has something similar to Cisco IOS Event Manager … the "only"    difference is you can use Bash, Perl or Python instead of Tcl or something resembling    Basic from ZX81 (aka EEM applets).<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2012/01/nexus-vpc-orphan-ports.html">Nexus vPC Orphan Ports</a>: Orphan ports (servers connected to just one of the switches in an MLAG pair) are a    major pain … but I never realized the attached servers could experience a total    disaster if the vPC peer link fails.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/01/notes-on-scalability/">Notes on Scalability</a>: I know I'm preaching to the wrong choir here, but if you do manage to push these ideas    across to the apps development groups, your life will be so much easier.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2012/01/17/the-ascendancy-of-the-application-layer-threat.aspx">The Ascendancy of the Application Layer Threat</a>: In the never-ending tug-of-war, the DoS attacks have moved from TCP stacks to HTTP    servers, requiring a different type of protection - load balancers (oops, Application    Delivery Controllers) instead of firewalls.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://eos.aristanetworks.com/2012/01/disabling-mac-learning-on-712448-ssx/">Disabling MAC Learning on 7124/48 S/SX</a>: You want to turn your low-latency 10GE switch into a hub? No problem, Arista provides    an EOS extension that can meet those "special needs".<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2012/01/16/what-does-fcoe-have-to-do-with-vm-mobility/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+slowe%2Fcontent%2Ffeed+%28blog.scottlowe.org+Content+Feed%29">What Does FCoE Have To Do With VM Mobility?</a>: You know I'm constantly ranting about the futility of unlimited VM mobility. Scott    Lowe has described the storage perspective, and it looks as futile as the networking    one.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://garyberger.net/?p=537">NodeFlow: An OpenFlow Controller Node Style</a>: An OpenFlow controller written in JavaScript. Let the fun begin!<br clear="none"/></p>
<h4>Internet and IPv6</h4><p><a href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2012-01/2011.html">ISP Column - January 2012</a>: Another Geoff Huston's article full of statistics, some of them very interesting,    others less so. The most relevant one: prediction of IPv4 exhaustion date by region    (RIR).<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://packetpushers.net/why-your-network-should-go-ipv6-only/">Why Your Network Should Go IPv6 Only</a>: A well-argumented push for IPv6-only access networks. Must read.<br clear="none"/></p>
<h4>Security and VPNs</h4><p><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2012/01/20/the-fundamental-problem-with-traditional-inbound-protection.aspx">The Fundamental Problem with Traditional Inbound Protection</a>: Yet another article with the now-familiar theme: firewalls can't protect us any longer    because most of the attacks happen above HTTP.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ipexpert.com/2012/01/10/mpls-l3vpn-and-summarized-loopback-routes/">MPLS L3VPN and Summarized Loopback Routes</a>: A great (and lengthy) explanation of why we shouldn't summarize loopbacks in MPLS/VPN    networks by my good friend @icemarkom. Particularly loved the static FEC-to-label    bindings at the end ... if only he would add a few static MPLS labels in the P-routers    :)<br clear="none"/></p>
<h4>Other topics</h4><p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ItDepends">It Depends</a>: You might have thought "it depends" is a simple cop-out answer. Think again ... after reading this article.</p>
<p><a href="http://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a>: A fantastic article - starting with modern computer architectures, moving through    the "end of Moore's law", explaining why multi-core iPad 2 is part of the    same trend as AWS ... and it goes on and on and on ...<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2012/on-insecurity-and-writing/">On insecurity and writing</a>: This is a must-read for all my friends who endlessly hesitate trying to decide whether    to write another blog post or not. You know who you are ;)<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://packetpushers.net/successfully-managing-talented-technical-people/">Successfully Managing Talented Technical People</a>: Another large dose of commonsense from Ethan Banks. Highly recommended reading.<br clear="none"/></p>
<p><a href="http://dubinko.info/blog/2012/01/14/call-a-spade-a-spade/">Call a Spade a Spade</a>: Fancy marketing terminology is obviously not new. Ted Nelson was writing about it    in 1974.<br clear="none"/></p>
