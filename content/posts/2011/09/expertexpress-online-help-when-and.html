<p>Occasionally my readers ask me if I would be available for a consulting/design project (or send me questions that are actually design review/second opinion challenges). I usually recommend using our <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Ps">Professional Services</a> team for larger projects (I try to do only a few larger consulting projects per year ... but that shouldn’t stop you from asking ;), but quite often the amount of work involved is so low that it simply doesn’t make sense to go through all the paperwork nightmare and I decided to create <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress service</a> to address those cases.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>How can you use it?</strong> Anything goes. I’ve been doing technology briefings, design reviews, router configurations, troubleshooting ... Just make sure your problem is well-defined so we won’t spend time trying to figure out what the problem is.</p>
<p><strong>What do you need?</strong> An interesting challenge and some spare budget. Network diagrams and documentation help. We’ll use WebEx, so it makes sense to have a diagram that approximates your network topology to draw on.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> It’s just a few simple steps:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You send me the description of the topic you’d like to cover. I might say no – after all, although I have lots of opinions, I’m not anywhere close to an expert in many fields.</li>
<li>You walk through Google checkout, we schedule the WebEx call, and we try to solve your problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No paperwork?</strong> No paperwork. </p>
<p>No NDA; if you’re concerned about your confidential data, change the network diagrams/addressing/configurations, and contact me from your private e-mail address. Also, don’t forget that I’m in a reputation-based business; I can’t afford to be a blabbermouth.</p>
<p>No SOW; the service definition is clear &amp; simple – we’ll try to solve your problem in a live WebEx conference call, we’ll spend between one and one and a half hour, and I’ll refund you (actually, cancel the credit card transaction) if you’re not happy with the results.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions?</strong> Sure – don’t expect me to read book-size network designs or write extensive follow-up reports.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps?</strong> Read the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/ExpertExpress">service definition</a>, find an interesting challenge, and <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/cms/bin/contact?StySu=ExpertExpress+enquiry">get in touch with me</a>.</p>
