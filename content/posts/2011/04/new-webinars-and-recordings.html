<p>A very short update on the status of my webinars (if you need more information, <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Contact">send me an e-mail</a> or a <a href="http://twitter.com/ioshints">tweet</a>): </p>
<h4>New webinars</h4><p>Cisco has introduced several interesting DMVPN features after I created my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN:_From_Basics_to_Scalable_Networks"><em>DMVPN: From Basics to Scalable Networks</em></a> webinar. The new <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN_New_Features"><em>DMVPN: New Features</em></a> webinar (<a href="http://dmvpn150.eventbrite.com/">register</a>) describes them as well as DMVPN-IPv6 integration.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DCI"><em>Data Center Interconnects</em></a> webinar extends the DCI section of the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DataCenterIntro"><em>Data Center 3.0</em></a> webinar and describes active-active data center designs and layer-2 and layer-3 interconnects.</p>
<!--more--><p>Iâ€™m planning to roll out at least one other new webinar before the summer break. More details to follow (hint: <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/about/">Scott Lowe</a> has offered his help in content development).</p>
<h4>New recordings</h4><p><a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseMPLS">Enterprise MPLS/VPN Deployment</a> webinar is now available as a <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">recording</a>, raising the number of webinars available as recordings to eight.</p>
<p>You can get all of them (plus access to all live sessions in 12 months after purchase) as part of the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">yearly subscription to @ioshints webinars</a>.</p>
