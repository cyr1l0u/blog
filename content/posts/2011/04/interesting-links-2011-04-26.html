<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peterthegreategg.JPG" style="float: right" title="Peter the Great Faberge Egg from Wikimedia Commons"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Peterthegreategg.JPG/150px-Peterthegreategg.JPG" /></a>You know I’m usually publishing the <em>interesting links </em>posts on Sundays, but I was simply too busy searching for Easter eggs (unfortunately not the ones pictured on the right) ... and I also found a few gems for you.</p>
<p>Starting with special thanks to Joe Onisick for <a href="http://twitter.com/jonisick/status/60734920363999232">reminding me what blogging is all about</a>. Following his lead, I <a href="http://www.despair.com/blogging.html">stumbled across this web site</a> which also nicely explains the <a href="http://www.despair.com/marketing.html">architectural vision of various cloud products</a>. In the same category, here’s a nice <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/fix_computer">flowchart that will help you fix your computer</a>, regardless of the OS you’re using.</p>
<!--more--><h4>Data Centers and Cloudy Skies</h4><p>Greg Ferro did the homework I was planning to do (thanks, Greg) – figuring out <a href="http://etherealmind.com/how-many-10-gbe-ports-do-you-need/">how many 10GE ports you might actually need in a data center</a> (direct consequence: do you really care about the petabit-promising fabric architectures?).</p>
<p>Packet Pushers had a <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-41-media-management-security-breach-rsa-comodo-low-cost-data-centre-design-l3-switch-vs-router/">fantastic podcast with Mrs. Y</a> (absolutely worth listening to) where they also discussed building low-cost data center. The High Scalability blog has a <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/4/20/packet-pushers-how-to-build-a-low-cost-data-center.html">nice summary of that discussion</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/4/18/6-ways-not-to-scale-that-will-make-you-hip-popular-and-loved.html">6 ways not to scale that will make you popular &amp; loved</a> is an excellent description of some of the stupidities one can do when building a supposedly large-scale service. Oh, just in case you’re not sure whether your design is broken enough, throw in Microsoft’s SQL server, Network Load Balancing and Windows Server Failover Clustering.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2011/04/19/sorting-out-cloud-security/">Sorting out cloud security</a> – a great discussion of various aspects of cloud-related security challenges.</p>
<p>Two years ago Dave Graham was <a href="http://flickerdown.com/2009/03/a-vision-of-failure/">writing about the upcoming failures in public clouds</a> (and recommended building a private cloud for less money using what you already have). As always, many people preferred to believe in miracles of shiny new technology.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>Stretch continues the <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/category/ipv6/">IPv6 series</a>, this time with <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/apr/18/ipv6-neighbor-discovery-high-availability/">high-availability aspects of IPv6 neighbor discovery</a>.</p>
<p>Mobitel (the biggest Slovenian mobile operator) has enabled (free-of-charge) <a href="http://www.cellular-news.com/story/48817.php">IPv6 support in its production environment</a>; two out of three major Slovenian mobile operators now have IPv6 in production. Congratulations, Mobitel and <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/593598-tusmobil-to-take-part-in-global-ipv6-day">Tuš Mobil</a>; you guys rock. To all the foot-draggers out there: Don’t tell me it can’t be done.</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6164">RFC 6164 - Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links</a>. Finally someone has taken steps to get away from the “<em>we need a whole IPv4 Internet ... squared ... on every point-to-point link</em>” stupidity that has been haunting us.</p>
<p>The Patticon blog has a <a href="http://blog.pattincon.com/lisp-papers">nice set of LISP-related articles</a>.</p>
<h4>Other bits &amp; pieces</h4><p><a href="http://aconaway.com/2011/04/19/the-four-stages-of-expertise-in-your-mind/">Four stages of expertise</a> – a must read for anyone entering a new field (including yours truly).</p>
<p>Ethan Banks @ PacketAttack has published a fantastic “<a href="http://packetattack.org/2011/04/19/crisis-calls-stereotyping-useless-participants/"><em>Crisis Calls: Stereotyping Useless Participants</em></a>” article. A must-read prior to every conference call you take.</p>
<p>I started my IT career on ancient boxes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">IBM 360</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a> (running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11M">RSX-11M</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11M#Quotes">great-granddaddy of Windows NT</a>). When <a href="http://twitter.com/ayourtch/status/60386431192932352">Andrew Yourtchenko published a link to a PDP-11 emulator</a>, I was immediately intrigued. The thing emulates the PDP-11 CPU in (emulated) Java Script (within a browser window) and runs an ancient version of Unix almost as fast as the original. We truly live in crazy times.</p>
