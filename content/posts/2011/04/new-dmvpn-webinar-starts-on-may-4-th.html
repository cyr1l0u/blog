<p>In less than a year since I developed the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN">original DMVPN webinar</a> (now available as a <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">recording</a> or part of <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">yearly subscription</a>), Cisco introduced numerous DMVPN improvements, including better management and scalability features. Most of them are covered in my new <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN_New_Features">DMVPN: New Features in Release 15.x</a> webinar <a href="http://dmvpn150.eventbrite.com/">debuting on May 4<sup>th</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The webinar will describe the following DMVPN improvements:</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong>. IPv6 over DMVPN, spoke-to-spoke DMVPN over NAT and hub-to-spoke QoS.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>. DHCP client on DMVPN spokes, simplified spoke configuration using hostnames, backup NHS and NHS clusters, and tunnel health monitor (including interface state control).</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>. DMVPN logging and DMVPN-related SNMP traps.</p>
<p class='note'>I’ve already started developing the content; if you have yearly subscription or have already registered for the webinar, you’ll find early drafts in my Webinar Management System.</p>
