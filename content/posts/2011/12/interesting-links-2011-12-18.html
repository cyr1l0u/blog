<p>The coolest tool of the week: <a href="https://github.com/mxtommy/Cisco-SSH-Client">mxtommy/Cisco-SSH-Client</a>. Thomas St. Pierre did a fantastic job - he modified SSH client to colorize the printouts    generated by Cisco routers (similar to what VIM is doing to source code). Download    his SSH client patches, recompile your SSH client, and enjoy!<br clear="none"/></p>
<p>And here are the other links accumulated in my Inbox, this time in somewhat more structured format ... and a (hopefully interesting) surprise at the end.<!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=1354">Redux: Patching the Cloud | Rational Survivability</a>: A 2-year old blog post from @beaker predicting the Amazon Reboot Fiesta. His crystal    ball is crystal clear ;)<br clear="none"/></p>

<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/12/12/netflix-developing-deploying-and-supporting-software-accordi.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HighScalability+%28High+Scalability%29">High Scalability - High Scalability - Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting       Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a>: Using VMs in the Amazon EC2 cloud allows Netflix to deploy new software versions to    production way easier that it's possible in a traditional data center.<br clear="none"/></p>

<p><a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/12/requiem-for-jumbo-frames.html">Coding Relic: Requiem for Jumbo Frames</a>: Another excellent article by Denton Gentry, describing the problems jumbo frames tried    to solve, and why they're largely irrelevant today.<br clear="none"/></p>

Even if the    app developers never heard of master/slave database servers, BIG-IP can load balance    a single IP address between R/W and R/O servers based on SQL requests ... if only    they'd implement support for transactions. But I guess that would be just a few more    tweaks to the iRules ;)<br clear="none"/></p>
