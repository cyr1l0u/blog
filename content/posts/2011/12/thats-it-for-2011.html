<p>2011 was a fantastic year for a networking geek, and you were awesome – helping me figure out the intricacies of new technologies, fixing my errors, and asking so many great questions that prompted me to dive deeper into the rabbit holes. I owe you a huge Thank you!</p>
<p>I hope you’ll be able to shut down your smartphones and pagers in the next few days and spend a few relaxing moments with your families … and I wish you great networking in 2012!</p>
