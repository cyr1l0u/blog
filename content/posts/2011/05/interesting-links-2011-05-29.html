<p>The article of the week is indubitably (how’s that for a Scrabble word?) <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6250">RFC 6250</a>, describing some of the stupidities (politely called <em>misconceptions</em>) TCP/IP stack had to deal with.</p>
<p>Other great content I stumbled upon during this week (in random order):</p>
<h4>Data center</h4><p>Christoph Jaggi published a new revision of his excellent Ethernet Encryptor Market Overview documents: <a href="http://www.uebermeister.com/files/inside-it/2011_Market_Overview_Ethernet_Encryptors_Introduction_L2_vs_L3.pdf">introduction</a>, <a href="http://www.uebermeister.com/files/inside-it/2011_Market_Overview_Ethernet_Encryptors_P2P.pdf">point-to-point</a> and <a href="http://www.uebermeister.com/files/inside-it/2011_Market_Overview_Ethernet_Encryptors_Multipoint.pdf">multipoint</a> products. All you ever wanted to know about encryption (and much more).<!--more--></p>
<p>Stephen Foskett had a great FCoE versus iSCSI presentation @ Interop. The same content is now <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2011/05/20/fcoe-iscsi-convergence-ethernet/">available on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>John Herbert wrote a lengthy <a href="http://lamejournal.com/2011/05/16/layer-2-routing-sort-of-and-trill/">In-depth description of TRILL</a>. Definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>The multihop FCoE saga continues with <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/converged-networks-vs-mononetworks/">another great post</a> by J Michel Metz. </p>
<p>Greg (@etherealmind) Ferro <a href="http://etherealmind.com/goldeneggs-server-comparison/">discovered</a> true Golden Eggs: <a href="http://goldeneggs.fi/">in-depth comparisons of x86 server platforms</a>.</p>
<h4>Cloudy services</h4><p>I’m not the only one allergic to marketing nonsense. <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/258009,five-reasons-your-product-isnt-a-cloud.aspx?eid=1&amp;edate=20110520&amp;utm_source=20110520_AM">Five reasons your product isn’t a cloud</a> is hilarious.</p>
<p>FathomDB decided to build a <a href="http://blog.fathomdb.com/53681308">truly resilient relational database</a>. Some people are learning from the AWS outage and accepting the harsh reality: IaaS clouds cannot be made fully reliable (or at least not at reasonable cost).</p>
<p>Evernote <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2011/05/17/architectural-digest/">described their SaaS architecture</a>. Read &amp; learn (also applies to apps, server and storage engineers).</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>Tore Anderson makes a good case for <a href="http://www.fud.no/talks/20110513-IPv6-Kongress-Inciting_Norwegian_IPv6_deployment.pdf">IPv6-only servers and stateless NAT64 in data center</a> (slides 27+).</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6180">RFC 6180</a> describes four typical IPv6 deployment scenarios and use of transition mechanisms. Must read #1.</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6127">RFC 6127</a> focuses on various forms of NAT. Must read #2.</p>
<h4>None of the above</h4><p>John McManus joins a long list of people telling vendors that <a href="http://networking-guru.net/?p=209"><strong><em>we need emulators to test our designs and configurations, not in the cloud</em></strong></a>. Not sure many vendors are listening.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/05/lessons-learned-in-remote-work.php">Five lessons learned in remote work</a>. If you ever get involved in work-from-home discussions, read this first.</p>
<p>Daniel Dib describes a fantastic little known functionality: <a href="http://lostintransit.se/2011/05/27/rmon-remote-monitoring/">RMON can trigger alarms based on values of any SNMP variable</a>. Yap Chin Hoong describes how you can use it to <a href="http://www.itcertnotes.com/2011/05/nx-os-cpu-thresholding-snmp-trap-rmon.html">monitor CPU overload in NX-OS</a>.</p>
