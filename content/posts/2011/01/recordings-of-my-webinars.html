<p>One of the regular questions I was getting throughout the last few months was “is it possible to buy just the recording of your webinar?” I tried to solve the problem with Eventbrite-based kludges, but finally gave up and implemented a Google Checkout-based solution. The whole process is extremely easy: select the recordings you’d like to buy from the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">list of recordings</a> and click the <em>Google Checkout</em> button; you’ll get access to Webex recordings, PDF materials and router configurations (only for select webinars – check the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription/Materials">list of documents associated with each webinar</a>) a few seconds after Google processes your credit card information.</p>
