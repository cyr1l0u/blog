<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>I’ve always thought that Cisco introduced the <em>BGP Local-AS </em>feature into IOS to support complex MPLS VPN design scenarios. Obviously I was wrong, the early documentation always describes an ISP AS merging scenario. Unfortunately, all the articles I’ve found skip some important details: they describe the basics and the configuration commands, but <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Network_migration_or_merger_with_BGP_Local-AS_feature">forget to mention the impact on the AS paths received by the ISP customers</a>. Obviously we need a <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Network_migration_or_merger_with_BGP_Local-AS_feature">more thorough description of this feature</a>. </p>
