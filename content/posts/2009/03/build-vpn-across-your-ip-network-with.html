We implemented a true VPN solution for them (the hosts in the enterprise network cannot access the surveillance equipment and vice versa) using the Multi-VRF feature available in all recent Cisco IOS releases. The solution is described in the March <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article “<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/EnterpriseMultiVRF/">Add a VPN to an Enterprise Network with Multi-VRF Functionality</a>”.</p>
