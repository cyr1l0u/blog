<p class="more"><a href="http://www.perihel.at/2/basics/25-Routing-SPF-Algorithm.pdf">Check this short presentation</a> in case you’d like to get a bit more in-depth explanation of the SPF algorithm.</p>
<p>The second phase of the link state route selection algorithm is called <em>Partial SPF </em>in OSPF and <em>Partial Route Calculation (PRC) </em>in IS-IS. Obviously it’s beneficial if the router can react to a change in the network topology by running PRC, not the full SPF, and there are <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/SPF_events_in_OSPF_and_IS-IS">significant differences in the way OSPF and IS-IS respond to various topology change events</a>. The differences are not architectural; you could make OSPF behave as well as IS-IS. They just prove that the old wisdom is still true: very large IOS-based networks use IS-IS because it’s better implemented than OSPF.</p>
