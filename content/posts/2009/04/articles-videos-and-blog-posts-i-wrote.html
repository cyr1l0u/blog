<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I wrote so much about BGP in the last few years that even I find it hard to track all of the material. Fortunately everything has an RSS feed these days and the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 Wiki</a> has RSS feed integration extensions, so I was able to create a nice mash-up <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/References:Ivan_Pepelnjak_on_BGP">listing the major BGP topics Iâ€™ve covered in the last few years</a>.</p>
