<div class="bloggerBody"><p>True or false: If you have an (enabled) loopback interface configured on the router, its IP address will always be used as the OSPF router ID.</p>
<!--more--><p>Answer: False. Each OSPF process running on the router needs a unique Router ID. If you have a single loopback interface and two OSPF processes, the second OSPF process is forced to select another interface address as its router ID.</p>
<p>Here is a sample router printout:</p>
<pre class="code">Test#<strong>show running | inc ^interface|^ ip address</strong><br/>interface Loopback0<br/> ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.255<br/>interface FastEthernet0/0<br/> ip address 10.1.0.1 255.255.255.0<br/>Test#<strong>show ip ospf | inc Routing Process</strong><br/> Routing Process "ospf 2" with ID 10.1.0.1<br/> Routing Process "ospf 1" with ID 10.0.0.1</pre></div>
