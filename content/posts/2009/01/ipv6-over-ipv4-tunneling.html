<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The CT3 wiki is starting to grow organically. A few days ago, an excellent article “<a href="http://wiki.nil.com/IPv6_over_IPv4_tunneling"><em>IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling</em></a>” appeared out of the blue sky. Michael Aschwanden did a great job describing the IPv6 tunneling mechanisms and various free public services. He also included sample router configurations used to connect to the public tunneling services.</p>
