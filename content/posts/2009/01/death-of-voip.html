<div class="bloggerBody"><p>In another great example of “investigative journalism”, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/36891">Network World is asking whether the VoIP is dead</a> (and I guess I’ll never make it to their <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/25115">top-20 list</a> again). Regardless of their sensationalistic approach, take your time and <a href="http://macvoip.com/stn/?p=842">read the original articles they quote</a> (<a href="http://macvoip.com/stn/?p=841">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://macvoip.com/stn/?p=842">Part 2</a>). What the original author claims (and I don’t think you can disagree with him) is that VoIP has turned from hot technology to plumbing faster than some people would like. Whether that’s bad or not depends on the perspective … what’s yours?</p>
