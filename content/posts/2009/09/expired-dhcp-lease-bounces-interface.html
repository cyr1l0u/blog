<div class="bloggerBody"><p>You would think that an expired DHCP lease is not a big deal for a DHCP client. Although the interface IP address is lost, you can always try to get a new address from the DHCP server.</p>
<p>IOS has a different opinion: when the DHCP lease expires on a router configured with <strong>ip address dhcp </strong>interface configuration command, the interface is administratively shut down and re-enabled. Here’s a sample printout taken from a router running 12.4(24)T software:</p>
<pre class="code">%DHCP-5-RESTART: Interface FastEthernet0/1 is being restarted by DHCP<br/>%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to administratively down<br/>%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to down<br/>%LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to up<br/>%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to up<br/>%DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface FastEthernet0/1 assigned DHCP address 10.17.1.15, mask 255.255.255.0, hostname Client</pre><p>You might wonder how you could ever end up with an expired lease when there’s a working DHCP server on the network. It’s simple if your DHCP server runs on IOS: when you clear the DHCP bindings on a router running a DHCP server, it <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/DHCP_client_address_change">stops responding to lease extension requests (DHCPREQUEST packets) from unknown clients</a>.</p>
