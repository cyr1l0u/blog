<p>We’re running a two day IPv6 technical workshop next week. Its contents are equivalent to the IPv6 Fundamentals course with “a bit” longer days and without the lab exercises. It’s ideal for those that need to understand the IPv6 technology but don’t yet need the hands-on experience.</p>

<!--more--><h4>More details</h4><p>The IPv6 Workshop is a<strong> two-day event </strong>that provides baseline through advanced technical information and training on the next-generation Internet protocol, IPv6. </p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to prepare the learner for transitioning to IPv6 based networks. Workshop encompasses design considerations, security considerations, configuration principles, configuring Cisco IOS devices for IPv6 and IPv6 transition mechanisms. </p>
<p>Throughout the workshop participants will be presented the principles, concepts and practices for IPv6 deployment. This workshop will help network engineers understand Cisco devices running IOS software and covers the IPv6 routing protocols such as RIPng, OSPF, BGP, and IS-IS; IPv6 transition mechanisms including tunnels, ISATAP, NAT-PT, and 6to4; and other features. The design and deployment components present coverage of IPv6 design and deployment for DNS, DHCP, integrating IPv6 in an IPv4 network, Multicast, and much more.</p>
