<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">monthly IP Corner articles</a> you’re probably already familiar with cover a wide variety of technology or design issues. These articles are targeted at a pretty wide audience and thus don’t go into too many technical details. They’re also static: incorporating reader’s feedback or follow-up information is way harder than editing a Wiki article.</p>
<p>To enable easy integration of the IP corner articles with additional related information I’ve created numerous <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Category:IP_Corner">stub articles in the CT3 Wiki</a>. The entries in the Wiki describe the topic (technology or design solution) covered by the IP corner article and a link to the original text. Follow-up information will be easily added to the Wiki topic.</p>
<p>The names of the Wiki topics reflects the actual technology covered in the related articles, so you’ll find topics like <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/EIGRP_Stub_Routers"><em>EIGRP Stub Routers</em></a><em> </em>instead of <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/EigrpStub/"><em>Scaling EIGRP networks with stub routers</em></a><em> </em>(which does sound better in a monthly mailing). The topics have also been categorized, giving you an insight into the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/IP_corner_articles_%28by_technologies%29">technologies covered by the IP Corner articles</a>.</p>
<p class="important">Please note that this is an ongoing project; not all IP Corner articles have been covered yet.</p>
