<p>A while ago <a href="http://www.packetu.com/2014/05/02/one-cares-sdn/">Paul Stewart wrote a fantastic blog post</a> listing the potential business benefits of SDN (as promoted by SDN evangelists and SDN-washing vendors).</p>
<p>Here’s his list:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite" style="border: 1px dotted; background-color: #E0E0E0;"><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Abstracted Control Plane for a Central Point of Management</li>
<li>Granular Control of Flows (as required/desired)</li>
<li>Network Function Virtualization and Service Chaining</li>
<li>Decreased dependence on devices like load balancers</li>
<li>Facilitation of system orchestration</li>
<li>Easier troubleshooting/visibility</li>
<li>Platform for chargeback/showback</li>
<li>Decreased complexity and cost</li>
<li>Increased ability to utilize hardware and interconnections</li>
<li>DevOps friendly architecture</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have just one problem with this list – I’ve seen a similar list of benefits of IPv6:</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/05/s1600-IPv6+Myths+(Promised).jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/05/s550-IPv6+Myths+(Promised).jpg"/></a></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality of IT in general and IPv6 in particular is a bit different. The overly hyped IPv6 benefits remain <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html">myths and legends</a>; all we got were longer addresses, incompatible protocols (OSPFv3 anyone), and half-thought-out implementations (example: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html">DNS autoconfiguration</a>) ridden with religious wars (try to ask “<em>why don’t we have first-hop router in DHCPv6</em>” on any IPv6 mailing list ;).</p>
