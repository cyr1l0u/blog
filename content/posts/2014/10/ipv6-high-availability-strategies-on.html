<p>I had a <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/IPv6 High Availability Strategies - IPv6 Summit.pdf">shorter version of my IPv6 High Availability talk</a> @ Slovenian IPv6 summit this spring. The video is online, but wouldn&#x2019;t be of much use to anyone but both Slovenian readers of this blog.</p>
<p>The English version of that same talk is now <a href="http://tv.nil.si/pepelnjak_ipv6_high_availability_strategies/">available on NIL TV</a> (or you could decide to go <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_High_Availability_Strategies">for the full webinar</a> or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/IPv6_webinars">whole IPv6 track</a>).</p>
