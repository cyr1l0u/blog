<p>One of my readers sent me an interesting challenge: they&#x2019;re deploying a new DMVPN WAN, and as they cannot expect all locations to have native (non-NAT) IPv4 access, they plan to build the new DMVPN over IPv6. He was wondering whether it would work.</p>
<p>Apart from &ldquo;<em>you&#x2019;re definitely going in the right direction</em>&rdquo; all I could tell him was &ldquo;<em>looking at the documentation I couldn&#x2019;t see why it wouldn&#x2019;t work</em>&rdquo; Has anyone deployed DMVPN over IPv6 in a production network? Any hiccups? Please share your experience in the comments. Thank you!</p>
