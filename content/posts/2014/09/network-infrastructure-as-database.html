<p>A while ago I wrote about the idea of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/infrastructure-as-code-actually-makes.html">treating network infrastructure (and all other infrastructure) as code</a>, and using the same processes application developers are using to write, test and deploy code to design and implement networks.</p>
<p>That approach clearly works well if you can virtualize (and clone ad infinitum) everything. We can virtualize appliances or even routers, but installed equipment and high-speed physical infrastructure remain somewhat resistant to that idea. We need a different paradigm, and the best analogy I could come up with is a database.<!--more--></p>
<p>Imagine an organization that needs a large transactional database to run its business, and requires the frontline operators to modify data in that database with SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). I haven’t heard of anyone being even remotely that stupid – and yet that’s how most of us run our networks. Time to take another lesson from application development world.</p>
<p>It’s obvious that one should interact with a production database only through well-defined and thoroughly tested transactions (whether you call them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CICS">transactions</a>, application programs or web scripts is irrelevant). Direct CLI (SQL) access to the database should be either prohibited or limited to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should make changes to our network devices with well-defined transactions (example: <em>CREATE VLAN </em>or <em>REMOVE VLAN</em>). These transactions (call them scripts, playbooks or recipes if you wish) should be treated like any application code, and tested in a lab environment before being allowed to touch the production network.</p>
<p>And now for the usual set of objections:</p>
<p><strong>But I don’t trust scripts</strong>. Fantastic. Now tell me: is it better to rely on something that is tested and repeatable, or doing configuration changes on the fly hoping for the best?</p>
<p><strong>How do I know it will work?</strong> Welcome to the world of software development. Write code, include unit and integration tests, test everything, deploy in a pilot environment, and finally in production. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p><strong>But it might mess up my configurations</strong>. And you think nobody ever messed up their database? We have backups for a good reason – and most networking gear has some configuration versioning and rollback mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>But it might crash my switch</strong>. It might. Database systems have their own bugs, and I’m positive you were able to crash some databases with invalid data or weird requests a few decades ago… but guess what: unless we start screaming at the vendors, and vote with our wallets, nothing will change.</p>
<p><strong>What about maintenance windows?</strong> We have to use maintenance windows in current networks because we can’t trust the manual configuration process. When was the last time you could do your e-banking transaction only at 2AM on a Sunday morning? Once everyone starts trusting the network configuration transactions, you’ll be able to use them at any time.</p>
<p>Have you encountered any other objections? Write a comment!</p>
<p>Finally, you might decide that your network isn’t big enough to warrant a network automation solution (or that you don’t have the manpower to work on it). The next best thing you might do is <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html">decoupling</a>: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/virtual-appliance-performance-is.html">move the dynamic parts of your network infrastructure into the virtual world</a> where you can <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/infrastructure-as-code-actually-makes.html">treat is as code</a>, and keep the physical part of your network infrastructure as static as possible.</p>
