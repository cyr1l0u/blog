<p>You know how hard it is to get the network traffic statistics: interface counters are too coarse, Netflow records are too granular, Sflow is samplingâ€¦ life is hard for network monitoring Goldilocks. </p>
<p>In the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/3%20-%20Network%20Monitoring.mp4">Network Monitoring video</a> (part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases">Real-Life OpenFlow Use Cases webinar</a>) I explained an interesting alternative: you could get (hardware permitting) traffic counters with ever OpenFlow flow entry, resulting in any granularity you need.</p>
