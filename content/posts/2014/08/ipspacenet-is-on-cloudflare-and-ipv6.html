<p>After a week of testing, I decided to move the main ipSpace.net web site (<a href="http://www.ipspace.net">www.ipspace.net</a>) as well as some of the resource servicing hostnames to CloudFlare CDN. Everything should work fine, but if you experience any problems with my web site, please <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/contact?StySu=CloudFlare+Is+Broken">let me know ASAP</a>.</p>
<p class='update'>2014-08-27: Had to turn off CloudFlare (and thus IPv6). They don't seem to support HTTP range requests, which makes video startup time unacceptable. Will have to move all video URLs (where the HTTP range requests are expected coming from streaming clients) to a different host name, which will take time.</p>
<p><strong>Collateral benefit</strong>: ipSpace.net is now fully accessible over IPv6 – <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/enterprise-ipv6-the-first-steps-tickets-12036839511?ref=blog">register for the Enterprise IPv6 101 webinar</a> if you think that doesn’t matter ;)</p>
