<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Got this remark from one of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscribe/Five_SDN_Tips">SDN mailing list</a> subscribers:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">There are NMSs that are based on SNMP, their manufacturers that say they can replace an SDN architecture, because they allow to automate the management of the network.</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those &ldquo;Our idea looks so awesome in PowerPoint&rdquo; moments. Unfortunately, the reality tends to disagree with such claims. What I would love to ask those vendors (and I would love to know who they are) is:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What have they been doing the last 30 years?</li>
<li>Why are our networks still not fully automated after all this time?</li>
<li>What is all this SDN brouhaha about if they already solved the problem with SNMP?</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder what the answers would be ;))</p>
