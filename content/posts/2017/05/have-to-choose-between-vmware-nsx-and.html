<p>I keep getting questions along the lines of &ldquo;<em>should I go with VMware NSX or should I deploy Cisco ACI</em>&rdquo; every single week, and as you know it&#x2019;s hard to answer anything but <em>it depends </em>without spending hours on the topic.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s exactly what we plan to do in Zurich next Tuesday (May 16<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>) in a <a href="http://www.digs.ch/digs-workshop-evpn/">DIGS workshop</a> that will run in parallel with the Data Center &amp; Cloud Day (part of the <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/technology_conference/">SIGS Technology Conference</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll be able to attend all the DC Day keynotes (including the one I&#x2019;ll run with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/04/palo-alto-integration-with-cisco-aci.html">Christer Swartz</a>), exchange ideas with other attendees, and hopefully get more visibility into why or when it would make sense to use NSX or ACI.</p>
<p>To make the discussion as relevant as possible, I invited <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mitja_Robas">Mitja Robas</a> to be the co-presenter in the workshop. He deployed NSX, EVPN on Cisco Nexus 9000, and Cisco ACI in production, and gathered plenty of don&#x2019;t-do-that lessons in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some companies won&#x2019;t allow their engineers to discuss their challenges in public. If that&#x2019;s the case, and you're based in Central Europe, we could set up an onsite workshop&hellip; or you could attend the public workshop in Zurich to get a wider perspective, and then we&#x2019;d do a follow-up one with your team.</p>
