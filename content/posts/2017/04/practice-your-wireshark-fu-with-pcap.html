<p>Johannes Weber built a CCNP practice lab, configured 22 different protocols in it, and took packet captures of all of them happily chatting. To make things more interesting he <a href="https://blog.webernetz.net/2017/03/29/wireshark-layer-2-3-pcap-analysis-w-challenges-ccnp-switch/">created 45 challenges that you can solve with Wireshark using the pcap file he published</a>.</p>
