<p>I&#x2019;ll be doing several on-site workshops in the next two months. Here&#x2019;s a brief summary of where you could meet me in person.</p>
<p>A bit of manual geolocation first: if you&#x2019;re from Europe, check out the first few entries, if you&#x2019;re from US, there&#x2019;s important information for you at the bottom, and if you don&#x2019;t want to travel Europe or US, there&#x2019;s an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">online course starting in September</a> ;)<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Mini-RSA</strong>: Gabi Gerber is organizing a <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/technology_conference/">3-day technology conference in Zurich</a> (Switzerland, not Kansas) in mid-May. The first day will be focused on data center and cloud topics, the second one on security, and the final one on hacking. </p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll have the keynote on Tuesday morning and will hang around on Wednesday morning if you&#x2019;d like to sit down and have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>NSX, ACI and EVPN workshop</strong>: I&#x2019;ll run a <a href="http://www.digs.ch/digs-workshop-evpn/">half-day <em>NSX, ACI or EVPN</em> workshop</a> in parallel with the first day of that event, so you&#x2019;ll be able to attend all the keynotes, mingle with the other participants during lunch and evening, and discuss whether to use NSX, ACI, or EVPN the rest of the day. </p>
<p>My partner in crime will be Mitja Robas (some of you might know him from the last DIGS event or from the autumn 2016 <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">data center online course</a>), one of the few engineers with hands-on experience in rolling out NSX, ACI and EVPN in production environments.</p>
<p><strong>June DIGS workshop</strong>: The next DIGS event will be in mid-June, and I can&#x2019;t decide whether to do a workshop on Docker or network automation for non-programmers. A nudge in any particular direction would be highly appreciated (assuming you&#x2019;d like to attend one or the other).</p>
<p>Now for the <strong>US news</strong>.</p>
