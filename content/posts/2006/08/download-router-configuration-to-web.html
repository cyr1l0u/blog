If you have HTTP server enabled  on your router (on by default in many IOS releases, enable with <STRONG>ip http  server</STRONG>), you can download the current router configuration into your  web browser simply by typing in the URL <FONT  face="Courier New">http://router/exec/show/running/full</FONT>. To get the  startup configuration, use <FONT  face="Courier New">http://router/exec/show/startup-config/CR.</FONT><br /><br />Of course, you need to  authenticate to the router. By default, you can use anything as the username and  the <STRONG>enable-password </STRONG>as the password, but you&nbsp;also use  local usernames or AAA authentication. To <a href='http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/10/multilevel-web-http-access-to-router.html'>use local usernames</a>, configure <STRONG>ip http authentication local </STRONG>and enter username and password  with the <STRONG>username <EM>username </EM>privilege 15 password <EM>password</EM></STRONG> configuration command.
