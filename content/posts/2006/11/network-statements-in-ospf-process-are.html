When I was still teaching Cisco courses, we were telling the students that the order of <strong>network</strong> statements in an OSPF process was important if their ranges were overlapping; the first <strong>network</strong> statement that matched an interface IP address would place that interface in the corresponding area. This is no longer true, Cisco IOS now properly handles overlapping <strong>network ... area</strong> configuration commands.&lt;!--more--&gt;<br/>Consider the following example:<blockquote class="code">fw#<strong>conf t</strong><br/>Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.<br/>fw(config)#<strong>router ospf 100</strong><br/>fw(config-router)#<strong>network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0</strong><br/>fw(config-router)#<strong>network 10.0.0.0 0.0.3.255 area 1</strong><br/>13:06:57: %OSPF-6-AREACHG: 10.0.0.0 255.255.252.0 changed from area 0 to area 1<br/>fw(config-router)#<strong>network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.7 area 2</strong><br/>13:07:10: %OSPF-6-AREACHG: 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.248 changed from area 1 to area 2<br/>fw(config-router)#^Z</blockquote>
I've entered overlapping network statements, each one with a smaller address range. Not only does IOS detect that they overlap, it also prints nice syslog messages and reorders the commands in the running configuration. Well done !<pre class="code">fw#<strong>show run | begin router ospf</strong><br/>router ospf 100<br/> log-adjacency-changes<br/> network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.7 area 2<br/> network 10.0.0.0 0.0.3.255 area 1<br/> network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0</pre>
