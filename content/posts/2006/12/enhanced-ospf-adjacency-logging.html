The <strong>log-adjacency-changes</strong> OSPF configuration command got improved (IOS documentation claims it's happened in release 12.1) with the <strong>detail </strong>command that logs every step of OSPF adjacency establishment (sample printout below). Great troubleshooting tool :)<blockquote class="code"><br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from DOWN to INIT, Received Hello<br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from INIT to 2WAY, 2-Way Received<br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from 2WAY to EXSTART, AdjOK?<br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from EXSTART to EXCHANGE, Negotiation Done<br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from EXCHANGE to LOADING, Exchange Done<br/>%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 172.16.0.21 on Serial0/0/0.100 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done</blockquote>
