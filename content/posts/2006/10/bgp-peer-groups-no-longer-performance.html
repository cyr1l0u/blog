<DIV><SPAN class=987010308-23102006><FONT size=2>In Cisco IOS release 12.3T  (integrated in 12.4), we've got an interesting (and quite understated) BGP  feature: BGP <STRONG>peer-groups </STRONG>are no longer a <EM>performance  </EM>feature (previously, IOS used them to reduce the time needed to compute  outbound BGP updates). IOS now performs automatic grouping of BGP neighbors in  <A  href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123newft/123t/123t_4/gtbgpdpg.htm">dynamic  update peer-groups</A> that receive identical BGP updates based on per-neighbor  outbound parameters.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
