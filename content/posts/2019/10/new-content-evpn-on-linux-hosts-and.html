<p>Dinesh Dutt added another awesome chapter to the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive">EVPN saga</a> last week explaining how (and why) you could <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=EVPN#HOSTS">run VXLAN encapsulation with EVPN control plane on Linux hosts</a> (TL&amp;DR: think twice before doing it).</p>
<p>In the last part of current <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking">Azure Networking</a> series I covered <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AzureNet#EXTERNAL">external VNet connectivity</a>, including VNet peering, Internet access, Virtual Network Gateways, VPN connections, and ExpressRoute. The story continues on February 6th 2020 with Azure automation.</p>
<p>Youâ€™ll need <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Standard ipSpace.net Subscription</a> to access both webinars.</p>
