<p>You might have noticed that our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/Sessions">Winter 2019 webinar schedule got crazily busy</a> with seven live sessions in the first two months of the year (another first)&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not all, there are two more live sessions that we haven&rsquo;t announced yet as we always schedule a single live session of a particular webinar.</p>
<p>Wondering what&rsquo;s coming during the rest of 2019? Starting with committed ideas:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Following AWS Networking webinar, we&rsquo;ll do a similar one on Azure (in early autumn 2019) and GCP (late 2019 or early 2020);</li>
<li>The materials for Docker 101 refresh has been ready for quite a while (subscribers can already <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DockerWS">download the slide deck</a>), but we simply couldn&rsquo;t cram it into 2018 schedule. It&rsquo;s currently scheduled for late spring.</li>
<li>Matthias Luft will run a series of webinars on cloud security;</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll do more on VMware NSX: Matthias Luft will talk about attacking NSX-T in a few days, I&rsquo;ll do NSX-T deep dive (similar to what I did for NSX-V in 2018) and Mitja Robas will talk about NSX-V design and planning;</li>
<li>We hope Mitja will have time to do Cisco ACI deep dive;</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also start a completely new series focused on networking fundamentals &ndash; not the usual &ldquo;introduction to technology&rdquo; or &ldquo;this is how you configure stuff&rdquo; things (there&rsquo;s plenty of material out there doing that) but focusing on <em>why </em>things work the way they do and the true fundamentals of networking, including related math challenges:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Rachel Traylor will continue her series of math-in-networking webinars with queuing theory and in-depth discussions of graphs and reliability;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll do a series of webinars on networking fundamentals, starting with <em>Business aspects of networking</em> and <em>Why should you care about networking </em>and then slowly working up the stack. Expect this to be a multi-year effort ending with <em>Dead Technologies and Why They Died.</em></li>
<li>Dinesh Dutt will complement that material with Open Networking webinars explaining how to do networking on Linux and Linux-based network devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s a list of things we <em>might </em>do:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Networking in Kubernetes;</li>
<li>OpenStack networking;</li>
<li>Product-specific SD-WAN webinars (Viptela and Velocloud come to mind);</li>
<li>IPv6 deployment experiences;</li>
<li>EVPN in Service Provider environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested in any of these? Have other ideas? Please send me an email or write a comment.</p>
