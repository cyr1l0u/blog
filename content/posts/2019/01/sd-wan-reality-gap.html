<p>Here&rsquo;s some feedback I got from a subscriber who got pulled into an SD-WAN project:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I realized (thanks to you) that it&rsquo;s really important to understand the basics of how things work. It helped me for example at my work when my boss came with the idea &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll start selling SD-WAN and this is the customer wish list&rdquo;. Looked like business-as-usual until I realized I&rsquo;ve never seen so big a difference between reality, customer wishes and what was promised to customer by sales guys I never met. And the networking engineers are supposed to save the day afterwards&hellip;</blockquote>
