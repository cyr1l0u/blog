<p>Last week Howard Marks completed the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Hyper-Converged_Infrastructure_Deep_Dive">Hyperconverged Infrastructure Deep Dive</a> trilogy covering smaller HCI players (including Cisco&rsquo;s Hyperflex) and explaining the intricacies of costing and licensing HCI solutions. </p>
<p>On Thursday I finally managed to start the long-overdue <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">Data Center Interconnects</a> update. The original webinar was recorded in 2011, and while the layer-3 technologies haven&rsquo;t changed much (with LISP still being mostly a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/why-is-cisco-pushing-lisp-in-enterprise.html">solution in search of a problem</a>), most of the layer-2 technologies I described at that time vanished, with OTV being a notable exception. Keep that in mind the next time your favorite $vendor starts <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/05/response-vendors-pushing-stretched.html">promoting another wonderful technology</a>.</p>
<p>You can get access to both webinars with standard <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
