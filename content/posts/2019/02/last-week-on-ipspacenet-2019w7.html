<p>Last Tuesday we continued the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#NET_CMD">deep dive into new Ansible networking modules functionality</a> introduced in recent software releases (up to 2.7), including a demonstration of a few simple playbooks that collect printouts from network devices and check software version or end-to-end connectivity.</p>
<p>In the second half of the live session we started digging into the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#NET_CFG">intricacies of device configuration management</a>, ending with the truly “fun part”: changing access control lists on Cisco IOS.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar is part of standard <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a> and Building Network Automation Solutions online course.</p>
