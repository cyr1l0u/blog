<p>Every now and then I get a question along the lines of <em>I’m your subscriber and would like to know more about X</em>, so I decided to start creating <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/">technology-specific pages</a> on www.ipSpace.net that would include links to most relevant ipSpace.net blog posts, webinars, sections in our online courses, and interesting third-party resources.</p>
<p>The subscriber triggering this process asked me about Intent-Based Networking, so <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/intent-based-networking.html">here’s the relevant resources page</a>.</p>
