<p>Here’s another back-to-the-fundamentals question I received a while ago when <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/new-in-ipv6-next-chapter-in-ipv6.html">discussing IPv6 multihoming</a> challenges:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I was wondering why enterprise can’t have dedicated block of IPv6 address and ISPs route the traffic to it. Enterprise shall select the ISP's based on the routing and preferences configured?</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try to analyze where the problem might be. First the no-brainers:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A consumer device with high-availability requirements: use two independent uplinks (WiFi + 5G). As long as the traffic from both uplinks doesn’t merge before being sent to upstream ISPs you don’t have a problem (the proof is left as an exercise for the reader);</li>
<li>An organization with a single uplink to a single ISP: no problem. Use provider-assigned IPv6 address (ideally delegated via DHCPv6 IA_PD) and put all your services into a cloud, or use dynamic DNS if you want to save $10/month.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">I describe the customer- and provider side of this setup in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Large_IPv6_Service_Provider_Networks">Building Large IPv6 Networks</a> webinar.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A large single-site organization with one or more Internet uplinks: get your own IPv6 address space and use BGP to advertise your prefix(es) to upstream ISPs. The same approach works for an enterprise with multiple large sites.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">It’s worth noting at this point that an Internet service that includes provider-independent address space advertised by BGP tends to be an order of magnitude more expensive than a residential service with the same speed… just because customers with such requirements are willing to pay more.</p>
<p>Now for the trickier use case: small office of a large enterprise. Even if they’d be willing to pay for enterprise-grade Internet access for every 3-person sales office in the middle of nowhere, do you really think that the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/anyone-can-get-ipv6-pi-space-buy-more.html">global Internet would survive</a> carrying <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/ipv6-provider-independent-addresses.html">provider-independent /48 prefixes</a> for every single small office of every rich-enough organization out there?</p>
<p>A similar one: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/new-in-ipv6-next-chapter-in-ipv6.html">small organization with two uplinks</a>. They won’t pay for enterprise-grade Internet service, and won’t get provider-independent IPv6 address space because it’s too expensive. IETF has been tackling various aspects of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/small-site-multihoming-in-ipv6-mission.html">this elephant</a> for a decade and still hasn’t got anywhere close to solving it.</p>
<p>You might wonder how many small sites really need two uplinks. Lots of SOHO offices or remote workers do – one the uplinks is a site-to-site VPN with the mothership. You could solve 95% of this problem with host-based IPsec VPN or SSL VPN (in both cases you don’t care about the transport IP address of the client) or with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/before-commenting-on-someone-mentioning.html">SSL proxy</a>, but there’s always the problem of remote printers and IP phones. Johannes Weber described the challenges of using VPNs with dynamic IPv6 prefixes in his <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers18/agenda/9grrde/">Troopers 2018 presentation</a>… and it’s not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>Anything else I’ve missed? Please write a comment.</p>
