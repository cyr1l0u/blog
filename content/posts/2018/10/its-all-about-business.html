<p>A few years ago I got cornered by an enthusiastic academic praising the beauties of his cryptography-based system that would (after replacing the whole Internet) solve all the supposed woes we&rsquo;re facing with BGP today.</p>
<p>His ideas were technically sound, but probably won&rsquo;t ever see widespread adoption &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have great ideas if there&rsquo;s not enough motivation to implementing them (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449389627/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1449389627&amp;linkId=c9a976737625d7da43044086479fad50">The Myths of Innovation</a> is a mandatory reading if you&rsquo;re interested in these topics).<!--more--></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a pretty useful filter you can use when someone tries to tell you he solved a really hard problem:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Find out all the prior proposed solutions (if the problem is worth solving, someone else probably tried to solve it before);</li>
<li>Figure out whether the other solutions failed due to technical reasons (in which case there might be hope);</li>
<li>If the prior solutions were technically feasible but weren&rsquo;t accepted, there might be a business reason for that;</li>
<li>If the proposed solution sufficiently changes the business model, there might be hope. Otherwise, move on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming back to BGP example:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>We had RPKI for years. Uptake is minimal;</li>
<li>BGPsec was also developed years ago. Nobody even thinks about using it due to the additional compute overload it would create;</li>
<li>There are tools to generate prefix lists from public routing databases. A very small percentage of ISPs cares enough about the quality of Internet routing to use them&hellip; in many cases due to someone passionate about quality like <a href="http://instituut.net/~job/">Job Snijders</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s wrong with the BGP world, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Russ_White">Russ White</a> (among numerous other things one of many <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Authors">ipSpace.net webinar authors</a> and member of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress team</a>) nicely explained it in <a href="https://rule11.tech/bgp-security-a-gentle-reminder-that-networking-is-business/"><em>BGP Security: </em><em>A</em><em> Gentle Reminder that Networking Is Business</em></a>. Have fun!</p>
