<p>Stumbled upon &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.cimicorp.com/?p=3397"><em>Is Tech News Fake</em></a>&rdquo; article by Tom Nolle. Here&rsquo;s the gist of his pretty verbose text:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">When readers pay for news, they get news useful to readers.&nbsp; When vendors pay, not only do&nbsp;<strong>the vendors</strong>&nbsp;get news they like, the rest of us get that same story.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the story being told is a lie, but that it reflects the view of an interested party&nbsp;<strong>other than the reader</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>High-quality content is not cheap, so always ask yourself: who&rsquo;s paying for the content&hellip; and if it&rsquo;s not you, you may be <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/761830/youre-not-facebooks-customer-youre-facebooks-product">the product</a>.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: ipSpace.net is funded exclusively with subscriptions and online courses. Some of our guest speakers work for networking vendors, but we always point that out, and never get paid for that.</p>
