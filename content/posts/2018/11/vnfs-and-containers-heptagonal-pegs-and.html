<p>One of my readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">It would be nice to have a blog post or a webinar describing how to implement container networking in case when: (A) application does not tolerate NAT (telco, e.g. due to SCTP), (B) no DNS / FQDN, is used to find the peer element and (C) bandwidth requirements may be tough.</blockquote>
<p>The only thing I could point him to is the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DockerNet">Advanced Docker Networking</a> part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Networking_Fundamentals">Docker Networking Fundamentals</a> webinar (available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free subscription</a>) where macvlan and ipvlan are described.<!--more--></p>
<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t help adding&hellip;</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I would be very skeptical about running something that cannot tolerate IP address changes or use DNS in a container. It&rsquo;s like trying to fit a heptagonal peg with spikes into a triangle hole.</blockquote>
<p>His response didn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">In mobile networks, pushing a square peg through a round hole is a common and repetitive task. A while ago, special hardware was used to get performance. Now, we put everything into a cloud and use commodity HW. No wonder we lose performance, and as a result, we need special accelerators and other tricks&hellip; thus we end up with something that&rsquo;s not scalable nor commodity any more.</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I opened a bag of popcorn when the whole &ldquo;<em>NFV/VNF will allow service providers to use </em><em>free software on </em><em>commodity hardware</em>&rdquo; hype started, and I&rsquo;m still enjoying the show.</p>
