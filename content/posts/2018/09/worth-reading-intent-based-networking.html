<p>Sa&#x161;a RatkoviÄ‡ (Apstra) published a must-read <a href="http://blog.apstra.com/intent-based-networking-taxonomy">Intent-Based Networking Taxonomy</a> which (not surprisingly) isn&rsquo;t too far from what I had to say about the topic in a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/intent-based-hype.html">blog post</a> and <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutUC#CS_INTENT">related webinar</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that the first three levels of intent-based networking he described match closely what we&rsquo;re discussing in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course and what <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Barroso">David Barroso</a> described in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutUC">Network Automation Use Cases webinar</a>:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Start with basic device configuration automation;</li>
<li>Migrate from &ldquo;device configurations are the ultimate source of information&rdquo; to single source of truth (abstracted network and services data model);</li>
<li>Perform real-time validation of network state.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively easy to develop an automation solution that meets the first three levels of Sa&#x161;a&rsquo;s definition. After all, that&rsquo;s what the attendees of our network automation online course have to do during a sequence of hands-on exercises, and many of them get to the very end (testing and validation).</p>
<p>The final stage he&rsquo;s describing (self-operation, or <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/self-driving-networks-with-kireeti.html">self-driving networks</a> if you work for vendor J) is sometimes called event-driven automation. <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Gee">David Gee</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mircea_Ulinic">Mircea Ulinic</a> covered the basics in the <a href="https://automation.ipspace.net/Public:8-Event_Driven_Automation">Spring 2018 session of the network automation online course</a> &ndash; just enough to show you how complex the topic can be, and how you could get started.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll have <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Carly_Stoughton">Carly Stoughton</a> talking about intent-based networking and Apstra AOS in the autumn 2018 session of the network automation course &ndash; if you want to ask her a few questions about the topic (including &ldquo;<em>when does it make sense to buy a solution versus building it yourself</em>&rdquo;) <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">register now</a>.</p>
