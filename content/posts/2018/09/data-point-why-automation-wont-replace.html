<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of good news for those of you scared of network automation replacing your jobs: <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-even-ai-powered-factories-will-have-jobs-for-humans">even Elon Musk didn&rsquo;t manage to pull it off</a>, so I don&rsquo;t think a networking vendor dabbling in intent will manage to do it (particularly considering the track record of networking vendors&rsquo; network management and orchestration systems).<!--more--></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something more interesting in that article: an overview of how Tesla had to retrain their workers and refocus them on higher-value jobs. Likewise, if you&rsquo;re configuring VLANs today, you might be asked to automate their configuration in the future, so you better start learning how to do that.</p>
<p>There are tons of ways you can learn about network automation tools for free &ndash; from vendor documentation, blog posts, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#SAMPLES">sample playbooks others have posted</a> on GitHub/GitLab, even <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/red-hat-ansible-presents-at-networking-field-day-18/">Networking Field Day videos</a>&hellip; </p>
<p>You can also invest a bit more and buy a few books, watch tutorials and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">deep-dive videos</a>, or go all in and enroll into a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">comprehensive interactive training program</a> full of hands-on exercises.</p>
