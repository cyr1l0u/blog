<p>Occasionally I’d invite a vendor speaker (usually working for an interesting startup) to present in my Data Center Fabrics webinar series. Dan Backman from Plexxi was <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/5.20 - Plexxi Affinity Networking.mp4">talking about affinity networking</a> in 2013, and in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">May 2015 update session</a> we’ll have Dinesh Dutt from Cumulus Networks talking about their software platform, architectures you can build with whitebox (or britebox) switches running Cumulus Linux, exciting network automation options, and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/bgp-configuration-made-simple-with.html">cool new features</a> they’re constantly adding to their software.</p>
