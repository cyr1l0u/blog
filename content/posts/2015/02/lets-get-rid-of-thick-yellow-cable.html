<p>Whenever I write about the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across.html">crazy things vendors are trying to sell us</a>, and the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/bridges-kludge-that-shouldnt-exist.html">kludges we have to live with</a>, I keep wondering, &ldquo;<em>Is it just me, or is the whole industry really as ridiculous as it seems</em>?&rdquo; It&#x2019;s so nice to see someone else coming to the same conclusions, like <a href="http://markburgess.org/bio.html">Mark Burgess</a> (the author of CFEngine and the Promise Theory) did in a <a href="http://markburgess.org/blog_broadcast.html">lengthy essay on whether SDN makes sense</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Long story short: there&#x2019;s no need for layer-2 in the data center beyond the virtual link between a VM (or container) and the virtual switch. We should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5">stop emulating the thick yellow cable</a>.</p>

<p class="info">The diagram is from the <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/474_ipv6_microsegmentation_done_right/">IPv6 Microsegmentation Done Right</a> presentation that I&#x2019;ll present @ <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers/">Troopers</a> 2015. There are still a few seats left, so make sure you <a href="https://www.troopers.de/registration/profile/">register ASAP</a>. You can also attend the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Microsegmentation">IPv6 Micro-segmentation webinar</a>, but it would be so much better to meet you in person.</p>
<p>Instead of desperately trying to emulate 40-year-old technology, we should strive to make data center networks layer-3-only networks and use DNS for service location.</p>
