<p>If you&#x2019;ve been a networking engineer (or a sysadmin) for a few years, you must be pretty familiar with DHCP and might think you know everything there is to know about this venerable protocol. So did I&hellip; until I read the <a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2015/09/just-some-quick-points-about-dhcp.html">article by Chris Marget</a> in which he answers two interesting questions:</p>

<li>How does the DHCP client receive the DHCP responses if it doesn&#x2019;t have an IP address?</li>
</ul>
