<p>One of my subscribers asked me: &ldquo;<em>My </em><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription"><em>subscription</em></a><em> is valid till early December. How c</em><em>o</em><em>uld I renew it now (due to budgetary reasons)?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I already had the process to do just that, there was no link that one could use (you had to know the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/buy?id=renew">correct URL</a>). I&#x2019;ve fixed that &ndash; you&#x2019;ll find the renewal link on the first page of my.ipSpace.net</p>
