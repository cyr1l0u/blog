<p>Another week, another story from the SDN land, this time <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/att_sorry_vendors_sdn_is_eating_your_lunch/?mt=1438337320442">The Register reporting on AT&amp;T plans</a>. Even though there are almost no details in the story, the headline boasts that “<em>SDN is eating vendors’ lunch</em>”, prompting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/4359316-6032825474927910912">SDN hopefuls on LinkedIn groups</a> to claim that “<em>the promise of SDN is fast coming to fruition</em>.”</p>
<p>Not so fast.<!--more--></p>
<p>All the talk about SDN-derived cost savings is a pipe dream until SPs decide to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/so-youre-open-source-shop-really.html">use open-source software</a> (or develop their own networking software like <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">Googles of the world do</a>). If you insist on having vendor support or single-throat-to-choke, you'll pay <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/whitebox-switching-follow-r-budget.html">approximately as much as you're paying today</a>.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that SDN and NFV add (not remove) complexity, and someone is bound to pay for that - either in CapEx (financing vendor R&amp;D) or OpEx (paying your people fixing open-source software).</p>
<p>Long story short: there's no free lunch regardless of what the evangelists, vendors and analysts would love you to believe.</p>
