<p>One of my readers recently pointed me to a <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/04/23/stretchdontbreak/">blog post written by Andrew Lerner from Gartner</a> describing the drawbacks of stretched VLANs.</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR</strong>: He’s saying more-or-less the same things I’ve been preaching for years. Now I can put <em>Blessed by Gartner</em> logo on my blog posts ;), and you can use the report to sway your CIO.<!--more--></p>
<p>Andrew starts by listing two misconceptions…</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>That we need stretched VLANs for VM migration (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">check</a>);</li>
<li>That we need stretched VLANs for active-active data centers (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/ip-renumbering-in-disaster-avoidance.html">check</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>… and lists four things to consider:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>WAN latency in LAN environment (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/latency-killer-of-spread-out.html">check</a>);</li>
<li>L4-7 service architecture and resulting traffic trombones (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/09/long-distance-vmotion-and-traffic.html">check</a>);</li>
<li>Resiliency and split-brain (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/stretched-clusters-almost-as-good-as.html">check</a>);</li>
<li>Traffic symmetry (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/vxlan-and-otv-saga-continues.html">check</a>);</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, he concludes that “<em>While these approaches may appear as a simple fix, they often increase complexity, reduce performance and availability, and increase the overall cost of your network.</em><em>”</em> <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/09/sooner-or-later-someone-will-pay-for.html">Yep</a>.</p>
<h4>Why am I writing about this?</h4><p>While it’s nice to see someone else coming to the same conclusions (particularly against strong headwind of vendor marketing), what matters most is that “<em>Gartner Said So</em>”. </p>
<p>I’ve heard sad stories from dozens of engineers telling me how they tried (and failed) to use my arguments to persuade their bosses that we shouldn’t <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">overcomplicate the network</a> to solve other people’s problems – now they can point to a Gartner report saying exactly the same thing. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, for some of those engineers the report came years too late – at least a few (that I know of) already got badly burned by a meltdown spreading across multiple data centers.</p>
