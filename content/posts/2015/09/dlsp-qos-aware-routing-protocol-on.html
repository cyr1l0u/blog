<p>When I asked &ldquo;<em>Are there any truly </em><em>QoS-aware routing protocol</em><em>s out there?</em>&rdquo; in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/routing-protocols-and-sd-wan-apples-and.html">one of my SD-WAN posts</a>, Marcelo Spohn from <a href="http://www.adaranetworks.com">ADARA Networks</a> quickly pointed out that they have one &ndash; Dynamic Link-State Routing Protocol. </p>
<p>He also claimed that DLSP has no scalability concerns &ndash; more than enough reasons to schedule an online chat, resulting in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_40-Dynamic_Link_State_Protocol_with_Adara.mp3">Episode 40</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>. We didn&#x2019;t go too deep this time, but you should get a nice overview of what DLSP is and how it works.</p>
