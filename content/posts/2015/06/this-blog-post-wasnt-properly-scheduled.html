<p>A few days ago I stumbled upon an interesting blog post by my friend J Metz in my RSS feeds. As with all blog posts published on Cisco&#x2019;s web site, all I got in the feed was a teaser (I know, I shouldn&#x2019;t complain, I&#x2019;m doing the same ;), but when I wanted to read more, I was greeted with a cryptic 404 (not even a fancy page full of images saying &ldquo;we can&#x2019;t find what you&#x2019;re looking for).<!--more--></p>
<p>Obviously I immediately sent an email to J asking him what had happened. His explanation: the blog post got taken down because it wasn&#x2019;t properly scheduled. Can anyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eREiQhBDIk">tell me what&#x2019;s wrong with this picture</a>? I thoughts blogs were all about relevant and timely information, but it seems the Social Media Experts decided to use Cisco Blogs (which were a great source of information) for scheduled release of corporate blabber. Too bad, I loved to read them.</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#x2019;re wondering what J was writing about (as I was), he <a href="http://jmetz.com/2015/06/05/lies-damn-lies-and-it-consultants-on-fcoe/">republished the blog post on his personal blog</a> &ndash; seems that&#x2019;s the best way to publish timely information in the age of corporatized social media.</p>
