<p>The <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/322_ipv6_security_summit/">IPv6 Security Summit</a> at the <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers/">Troopers conference</a> always has a few awesome IPv6 presentations (many people claim Troopers is the conference to attend if you&#x2019;re serious about IPv6), and this year was no exception. A day after the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/mld-considered-harmful.html">MLD bashing</a>, Enno Rey delivered a <a href="https://www.ernw.de/download/ERNW_Troopers15_IPv6SecSummit_DHCPv6.pdf">great in-depth presentation on DHCPv6 features and shortcomings</a>.</p>
<p>It seems the DHCPv6 intricacies presented in that talk were too much for some of the attendees &ndash; that afternoon I accidentally stumbled upon a visibly distressed gentleman who started our chat with &ldquo;<em>How could anyone expect us to deploy IPv6 in a production environment?</em>&rdquo;<!--more--></p>
<style>  .qa p { margin-left: 3em; }   .qa em { float: left; clear: left; margin-left: -3em; } </style><div class='qa'><p><em>Me:</em>Why would you say that?</p>
<p><em>Him:</em>Did you know that Android still doesn&#x2019;t support DHCPv6?<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Me:</em>That&#x2019;s old news. There have been religious debates on this topic on the v6ops mailing list and we never got anywhere. I don&#x2019;t expect it to change in near future.</p>
<p><em>Him:</em>But that&#x2019;s unacceptable. How could a service provider deploy IPv6 in their network?</p>
<p><em>Me:</em>There are plenty of service providers doing IPv6 right now. Some of them are even running IPv6-only networks with Android phones (example: T-mobile)</p>
<p><em>Him:</em>But service providers need stable customer IP addresses to reduce logging</p>
<p><em>Me:</em>In 3G/LTE world every device gets its own /64 prefix. It&#x2019;s easy to track users based on prefixes. (In DSL and cable environments every home CPE gets a delegated prefix, which is also easy to track).</p>
<p><em>Him:</em>You don&#x2019;t get it. Service providers need deterministic NAT to reduce logging, and it&#x2019;s impossible to do that if the device IP address changes</p>
<p><em>Me:</em>There&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v26BAlfWBm8">no need for NAT in IPv6</a> (at least not in the environments we&#x2019;ve been discussing, we <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/we-just-might-need-nat66.html">might need NAT66 in other scenarios</a>)</p>
<p><em>Him:</em>You&#x2019;re not listening. Deterministic NAT is a prerequisite.</p>
</div>
<p>At that point I decided I better leave and get a cup of chamomile tea.</p>
<p class='more'>For more dialogs like the one above, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v26BAlfWBm8">excellent video by Andrew Yourtschenko</a>.</p>
<h4>Takeaway</h4><p>It&#x2019;s disheartening to see that many network- and security engineers still don&#x2019;t get the basics of IPv6 at the time when it&#x2019;s becoming a Mission Impossible to get a reasonable-sized block of public IPv4 addresses. </p>
<p>To make matters even more depressing, it&#x2019;s not hard to get that knowledge, you just have to (A) admit you need it, (B) forget every preconception you have about IPv4, (C) accept that IPv6 is just <em>different</em> and (D) do something about your lack of knowledge.</p>
<p class='more'>To help you get started, I put together a list of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6">IPv6-related resources</a> (including plenty of free presentations and deployment guidelines).</p>
