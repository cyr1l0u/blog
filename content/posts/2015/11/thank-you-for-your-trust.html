<p>Wow, another year swooshed by. I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s almost gone. Maybe it&#x2019;s all the travels I had throughout the year, and I MUST start with a huge THANK YOU to whoever is watching after me &ndash; there wasn&#x2019;t a single major SNAFU.</p>
<p>Next, I&#x2019;d like to thank the people who caused all that travel: attendees of my workshops.<!--more--> Thanks for trusting me enough to invest your time and money into attending them. You were a fantastic audience and continuously kept me on my toes by asking pointed probing questions. It&#x2019;s amazing how much one learns by listening to people with various backgrounds and perspectives (honestly, that&#x2019;s the only reason I&#x2019;m willing to travel as much as I do).</p>
<p>However, the workshops probably wouldn&#x2019;t ever happen without people who keep me going &ndash; my loyal subscribers. Thanks a million for being there and helping me work on things I love doing: creating foundational training that no vendor would ever be interested in.</p>
<p>A few people made my days throughout the year by sending me &ldquo;I like your content&rdquo; emails. Thank you! I can&#x2019;t tell you how much a kind word helps when you&#x2019;re waiting at an airport or being stuck in a hotel.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#x2019;d like to thank everyone who wrote a comment, corrected my mistakes, pointed me to additional information, or offered a contrarian view. Thanks for keeping me honest!</p>
