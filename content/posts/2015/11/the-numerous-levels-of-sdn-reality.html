<p>A newbie exploring the mythical lands of SDN might decide to start at the <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition">ONF definition of SDN</a>, which currently (November 2015) starts with a battle cry:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The physical separation of the network control plane from the forwarding plane, and where a control plane controls several devices.</blockquote>
<p>The rest of that same page is what I&#x2019;d call the marketing definition of SDN: directly programmable, agile, centrally managed, programmatically configured, open standards based and vendor-neutral.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">If you&#x2019;ve been tracking the state of SDN products, you probably know that at least some of those claims aren&#x2019;t worth the cost of the bits transporting them.</p>
<p>Next level: <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/white-papers/wp-sdn-newnorm.pdf">SDN whitepaper</a>. One of the beauties I found in there: current network technologies cannot scale (page 6). I wonder who built the global Internet? Last time I checked, it wasn&#x2019;t running on an OpenFlow controller using centralized control plane&hellip; or maybe the mastermind behind that &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; claims that OpenFlow scales to interstellar distances, because we already have the first nodes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Internet">inter-planetary Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Going deeper into the <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/technical-library">technical details</a>, you&#x2019;ll find <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/TR_SDN_ARCH_1.0_06062014.pdf">SDN Architecture</a> document, which is so long it needs an <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/TR_SDN-ARCH-Overview-1.1-11112014.02.pdf">SDN Architecture Overview</a> companion. These documents already talk about the &ldquo;<em>logically centralized control planes</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>control exercised within data plane systems</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why is there such a huge discrepancy between the high-level marketing fluff and the technical documents? Because the reality tends to be complex and ugly regardless of what the marketers want us to believe, or in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk">immortal words of Colonel Jessep</a>: &ldquo;YOU CAN&#x2019;T HANDLE THE TRUTH!&rdquo;</p>
<div class='separator'><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zmQCmHwCRDY/Vj5attne7_I/AAAAAAAAIUk/3x2yYv-ozXk/s400/fewmengood.jpeg" /></div>
<p>Or maybe it&#x2019;s because after promising to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html">revolutionize the networking</a>, doing badly-needed gradual improvements on the stuff we&#x2019;ve been using for decades just isn&#x2019;t sexy enough.</p>
<p>Finally, if you feel you CAN handle the truth (and I know you can, or you wouldn&#x2019;t be reading this blog ;), start with the free <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_SDN">Introduction to SDN</a>, explore <a href="http://sdn.ipspace.net/">real-life SDN resources</a> on ipSpace.net, and continue your journey with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Advanced_SDN_Training">Advanced SDN training</a> (and I'm really sorry you missed last week's SDN retreat - we had fantastic sessions and great fun).</p>
