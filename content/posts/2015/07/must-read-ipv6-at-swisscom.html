<p>While some people <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/ipv6-is-here-get-used-to-it.html">lament the lack of IPv6 business case</a>, others are busy rolling it out – you (RFC 2119) SHOULD check out the <a href="http://www.ipv6conference.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B10-Swisscom-Status_Roadmap_and_Outlook_IPv6.pdf">Status of Swisscom’s IPv6 Activities presentation</a> from recent Swiss IPv6 summit.<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>67% of their customers are dual-stacked;</li>
<li>More than 20% of all the traffic is already IPv6 (with Google sourcing 60% of IPv6 traffic);</li>
<li>They launched IPv6-only LTE mobile infrastructure;</li>
<li>With the Internet traffic doubling every 2 years, they expect the peak of IPv4 traffic in 2020, peak of CG-NAT traffic in 2021, and no more IPv4 traffic after 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously you could ignore all that (after all, it’s just a presentation from an small European country) and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/ipv6-is-here-get-used-to-it.html?showComment=1435076689207#c7988183373485577517">stay stuck</a> at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Z3lmidmrY">first stage of IPv6 grief</a>.</p>
