Whenever I start digging into technical details, I learn something new. A few days ago I've stumbled across the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast">anycast</a>, which is a very interesting way to solve scalability issues:<ol><li>Deploy geographically dispersed servers using the same IP address (obviously they would also need a unique IP address or you wouldn't be able to manage them);</li>
<li>Advertise your service as residing on that IP address (for example, use the IP address in NS records for DNS zones you host)</li>
<li>Advertise the IP address (or corresponding IP prefix) into the Internet from multiple locations.</li>
</ol>
Although you could (theoretically) use anycast technology for any application, it works best with simple request-response UDP applications (for example, DNS). In all other scenarios, the application session would fail if the nearest anycast server would change following a change in the network.
