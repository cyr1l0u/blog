<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Deploying EIGRP as the PE-CE routing protocol in MPLS VPN networks is easy if <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/EIGRP_in_MPLS_VPN_networks">all sites have a single PE-CE link and there are no backdoor links between the sites</a>. Real life is never as simple as that; you have to cope with various (sometimes undocumented) network topologies. Even that would be manageable if the customer networks would have a clean addressing scheme that would allow good summarization (that happens once in a blue moon) or if the MPLS VPN core could announce the default route into the EIGRP sites (wishful thinking; the customer probably has one or more Internet exit points). </p>
<p>In the end, youâ€™re left with two-way route redistribution between core MP-BGP and edge EIGRP, resulting in nightmarish scenarios (probably a good half of the blog posts of the CCIE candidates talk about redistribution horrors). Fortunately, Cisco implemented two extra features supporting EIGRP-to-MP-BGP redistribution: BGP cost community and BGP Site-of-Origin. The <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihomed_MPLS_VPN_sites_running_EIGRP">Multihomed MPLS VPN sites running EIGRP</a> article I wrote in <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a> describes how you can use both features to get a reliable network even when doing two-way redistribution.</p>
