EIGRP was always described as the only routing protocol that can do unequal-cost load sharing. As it turns out, BGP is another one (although it's way more limited than EIGRP). For example, if you have two links into a neighbor AS, you can <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/EBGP_load_sharing#Unequal-cost_load_sharing">load-share across them proportionally to their bandwidth</a>. You can find <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/EBGP_load_sharing">all the details, sample configurations and router printouts</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.
