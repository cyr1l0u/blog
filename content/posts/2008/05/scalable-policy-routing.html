<p>If “policy routing” reminds you of nightmarish spaghetti solutions of hop-by-hop route-maps, read my <a href="http://learning.nil.com/tips-and-tricks/technical-articles/show/scalable-policy-routing/">Scalable Policy Routing</a> article. It describes how you can use a distance vector routing protocol (BGP is used in the article, but you could do the same with EIGRP or even RIP) to solve common policy routing problems in a highly scalable way.</p>
