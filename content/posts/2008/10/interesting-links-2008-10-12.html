<div class="bloggerBody"><ul><li>Greg Ferro published some <a href="http://etherealmind.com/2008/10/02/opinion-why-certification-matters-experience-less-so/">great thoughts on certifications versus experience</a>. While a lot of people tend to disagree with him (at least a bit ... myself included), he has some very good points. </li>
<li>Joe Harris posted the "<a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/09/30/ios-order-of-operation/">IOS order of operation</a>" list. Unfortunately it looks incorrect; I'm positive that in some cases <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/NAT_caveats_in_IOS_release_12.4T#Packets_rejected_by_inbound_ACL_generate_NAT_translations">NAT looks at the packet (and creates the translation) even if the inbound ACL drops it</a>.<br/> </li>
<li>Anyone who has ever been involved in security must read <a href="http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/vat/seals/maxims.html">Security Maxims from Roger Johnston</a> (hat tip to <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/09/security_maxims.html">Bruce Schneier</a>).</li>
<li>I got promoted to <a href="http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2008/10/firewalls-best-practice-holy-cows.html">holy cows</a>. At least I have <a href="http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2008/10/dmz-hopping-gobbledygook.html">good company</a>. BTW, if you're concerned about the security of your switch configuration, <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/notices/notic00004.cfm?Address=/snac/switches/switch-guide-version1_01.pdf">check what NSA has to say about it</a>.<br/></li>
<li><a href="http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/">Thinking problem management</a> has a great post explaining why you need <a href="http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2008/09/seeking-to-eliminate-techie-curse.html">service documentation</a>. </li>
<li>Ethan Banks is back and writes about RGEs (<a href="http://www.cciecandidate.com/?p=543">Resume Generating Events</a>). </li>
<li>Anthony Sequeira writes about <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/09/28/transparent-firewall-things-that-go-bump-on-the-wire/">transparent firewall on ASA/PIX</a>.<br/></li>
