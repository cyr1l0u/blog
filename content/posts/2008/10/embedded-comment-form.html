I've enabled the new "embedded comment form" in Blogger. This should make writing the comments a bit easier ... but Blogger is known to report weird errors every now and then when you're using the embedded form. If that happens to you, just press the "Publish" button yet again (after entering another CAPTCHA if needed).  I hope you'll find that the ease-of-use of the new form outweighs the occasional hiccups (and I won't even try to open a case with Google about this).
