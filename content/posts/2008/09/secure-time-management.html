As soon as you start relying on your routers having pretty exact time, NTP becomes part of your mission-critical network infrastructure and has to be protected protected against intruders or impostors.<br /><br />Default NTP settings on Cisco IOS allow intruders to change the router’s time or even current year as soon as the router is not synchronized directly with a primary (stratum 1) NTP server. In the <i><a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SecTimeManagement/">Secure Time Management</a></i> article, I'm describing a very simple NTP attack on an unprotected network and the safeguards you can put in place to prevent similar attacks.
