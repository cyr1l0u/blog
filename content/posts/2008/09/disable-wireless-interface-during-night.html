A friend has recently asked me for a solution that would disable the wireless interface on his SOHO router during the night. Two simple EEM applets later we had it working; I've also added a third applet to ensure the interface does not remain disabled after a router reload.<div style='text-align: right'>You can find the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Time-based_wireless_interface_activity">EEM applet code in the CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</div>
