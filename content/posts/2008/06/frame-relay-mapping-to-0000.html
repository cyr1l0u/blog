Someone has recently asked me what could cause a dynamic Frame Relay map to address 0.0.0.0. Before I had time to start investigating this weird behavior, <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/06/29/understanding-frame-relay-mappings-to-0000/">Internetwork Expert's CCIE blog published the answer</a>. Great job, Brian :)<p class="info">You might have to use Firefox to see the blog post, it didn't appear in my IE window.</p>
