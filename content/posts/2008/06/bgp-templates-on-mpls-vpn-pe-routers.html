BGP session and policy templates are a fantastic feature if you want to design scalable, easy to maintain BGP configurations. The IOS documentation doesn't even mention how they could be used in designs using multiple address families, for example in MPLS VPN networks; the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/BGP_Templates_on_MPLS_VPN_PE-routers">article I wrote in the CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a> should resolve any ambiguities.
