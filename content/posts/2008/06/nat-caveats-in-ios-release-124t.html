If you have upgraded your router from any other IOS release to release 12.4T without changing the NAT configuration (or used NAT configuration known to work into a router running IOS release 12.4T), you might have encountered weird behavior due to the changes in NAT implementation. The unexpected behavior and configuration fixes needed to avoid the NAT-related problems are described in my new <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/NAT_caveats_in_IOS_release_12.4T">NAT Caveats in IOS release 12.4T article</a>.
