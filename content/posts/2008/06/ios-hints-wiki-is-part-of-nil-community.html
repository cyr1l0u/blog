<a href="http://www.nil.com/go/community"><img src="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/images/logo.gif" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 5px 10px; border: none;"/></a>The careful visitors of my <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">Wiki</a> have probably noticed subtle changes in its design, particularly the logo in the upper-left corner. When we launched <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/community">NIL community</a>, my Wiki became an official part of it. I'm positive this change will result in even more high-quality content, as <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/ccie_experts">other experts within NIL</a> will contribute to the wiki. The wiki will go beyond Cisco (we provide end-to-end solutions including servers, Vmware, one-time password solutions and network management tools), so we've changed the name from <em>Ciscopedia</em> to <em>Communications Technologies Tips and Tricks</em> which has a nice acronym CT<sup>3</sup>.<p class="note">I would also kindly ask those of you who link to my Wiki to use the new URL (wiki.nil.com), not the old one (wiki.ioshints.info). I've set up automatic redirects, but it's better to use the final URL (it also improves the response time for the end-users).</p>
