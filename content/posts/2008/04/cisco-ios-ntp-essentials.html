What I got out of it (apart from a working example :) was the feeling that NTP and it's implementation in Cisco IOS was under-understood and under-documented, so I planned to write an article about it.</p>
<p>However, as I did my research, I figured out there's so much I didn't know about NTP (do you know what's the essential difference between a <em>peer</em> and a <em>server</em>?)that I decided to start with an introductory article explaining the basics of NTP, SNTP and their IOS implementation. It's been published under the name &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/BeOnTime/">Itâ€™s Good to be on Time</a>&rdquo; in the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP corner</a> section of <a href="http://www.nil.com/english">our company's web site</a>.</p>
