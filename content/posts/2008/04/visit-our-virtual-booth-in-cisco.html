Just before this year's Partner summit, Cisco has launched <a href="http://www.ciscopartnerspace.com/index.jsp">Cisco Partner Space</a>, a “virtual collaborative environment”. While I don't believe in the added value of eye candy, it sure looks nice.<br/><br/>During the Partner summit, the Cisco Partner Space hosts the virtual version of the event, including the exhibitor booths. You can visit us by choosing the <em>Reseller Exhibition Hall</em> (what a nice name, isn't it … all of a sudden, their Gold Partners are caller <em>Resellers</em>) from the menu on the first page (after you log in), selecting <em>Booths 26-36</em> and <em>NIL</em> from the Booth List. If you let me know when you'll go there, I might even be there to chat with you (I can't promise it, though).<a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/R_xmre5p-EI/AAAAAAAACRk/eNwxVy6UU2M/s1600-h/PartnerSpace.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187133768039266370" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/R_xmre5p-EI/AAAAAAAACRk/eNwxVy6UU2M/s400/PartnerSpace.jpg" style="display:block; margin:1em auto; text-align:center;cursor:pointer;"/></a>
