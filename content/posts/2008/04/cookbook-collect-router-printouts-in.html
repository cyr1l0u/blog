<p>Quite often, you'd like to include results of various <strong>show</strong> printouts as the body of the e-mail sent by an EEM applet. It's easy to include a single printout: execute the <strong>show</strong> command with the <strong>action cli command</strong> and include the <em>$_cli_result</em> variable in the e-mail body (more details can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Send_email_from_EEM_applet">Send email from EEM applet</a> article).</p>
<p>It's trickier to include outputs from several show commands in the same e-mail: you have to <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Mail_multiple_printouts_from_EEM_applet">collect the outputs into a file in the router's flash, list the contents of the file and send the result</a>.</p>
