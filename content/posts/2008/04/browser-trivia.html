I've started using Google Analytics just over a year ago, so I could do a nice analysis on which browsers my visitors are using compared to the situation a year ago. Firefox gained almost 10% market share while Internet Explorer has lost 13%.<a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/SAZQapm5qWI/AAAAAAAACR0/pLbnhwf36Rw/s1600-h/browserTrivia.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189924039366912354" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 10px auto; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/SAZQapm5qWI/AAAAAAAACR0/pLbnhwf36Rw/s320/browserTrivia.jpg" border="0" /></a>In the same period, the number of visits has increased by a factor of five. Not bad for an extremely geeky blog :)
