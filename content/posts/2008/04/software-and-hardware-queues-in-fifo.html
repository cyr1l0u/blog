I ran a few tests to document the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Queuing_Principles_in_Cisco_IOS/FIFO">differences between the fair queuing and FIFO queuing in Cisco IOS as well as the impact of queuing mechanism on the software/hardware queue used</a>. The results are stored on <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.
