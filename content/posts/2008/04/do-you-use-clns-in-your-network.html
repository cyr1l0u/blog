A few years ago, we've seen a lot of requests to design CLNS networks (primarily for network management purposes). I haven't heard about CLNS recently, so I'm wondering: is it still used or did it go the way X.25 did? You can help us all understand what's going on by responding to the quick poll I've set up: just open any page in my blog, select the answer from the poll in the top-right corner of the page and click <em>Vote</em> (the button might be labeled in your local language).<br /><br />More detailed observations are also most welcome: just <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23021255&amp;postID=681992130102067398">add a comment</a> to this post.
