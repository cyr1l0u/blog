A while ago I've been a co-mentor to a graduate student who investigated the difference between shaping and policing for his thesis. While doing the lab tests, he stumbled across an interesting problem: he could not configure fancy queuing (for example, CB-WFQ) on a point-to-point Frame Relay subinterface. The solution was to configure a QoS hierarchy, doing shaping first and queuing within the shaping queues.<br/><br/>A few days ago, Arden Packeer <a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/qos-voip/qos-applying-cbwfq-to-a-sub-interface/">covered the same topic in one of his blog posts</a>, so it looks like the underlying problem (and the solution) is not as widely known as I had assumed. Time to write a <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Queuing_Principles_in_Cisco_IOS">tutorial on Queuing Principles in Cisco IOS</a>.
