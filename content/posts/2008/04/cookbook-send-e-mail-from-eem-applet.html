I've described the <b>action mail</b> command that allows you to send e-mails from EEM applets in several posts. However, the posts were always focused on a particular task and the various <b>action mail</b> options were mentioned in passing. The <em><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Send_email_from_EEM_applet">Send e-mail from EEM applet</a></em> article contains a step-by-step recommendations on portable and scalable usage of the <b>action mail</b> command.
