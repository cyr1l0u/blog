Setting the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Queuing_Principles_in_Cisco_IOS#Where_to_queue">size of the hardware output queue in Cisco IOS</a> with the (then undocumented) tx-ring-limit (formerly known as tx-limit) has been a big deal when I was developing the first version of the QoS course that eventually became the initial release of the <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/BS_QOS22?Open&dm=&s=0&rid=C1256F0A00429755">Implementing Cisco Quality of Service</a> training. However, while it's intuitively clear that the longer hardware queue affects the QoS, years passed before I finally took the time to measure the actual impact. The <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Queuing_Principles_in_Cisco_IOS/Tx-ring-limit">results are available in my wiki</a>.
