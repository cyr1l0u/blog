The extended access-lists can be used in <strong>neighbor distribute-list in/out</strong> router configuration command or in a <strong>match ip address</strong> command within a <strong>route-map</strong>.<br /><br />When I've included a few slides on this feature in the first BGP course I've developed for Cisco (that was probably somewhere around 1994), the results in the class were always the same: total confusion that needed an hour of whiteboard examples to dissolve. You can find a few examples that will help you understand this arcane feature in <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/01/08/using-extended-acls-for-bgp-filtering/">a post written by Brian Dennis</a>.<br /><br />The use of extended IP ACL as a route matching mechanism was made obsolete by the <strong>ip prefix-list</strong> command, which was introduced in 12.0T. As 12.0T <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1828/prod_eol_notice09186a008032d3e2.html">reached End-of-Engineering in the previous millennium</a>, it's a safe bet that the only place where you might still be required to use extended ACLs to match IP routes is in the CCIE lab.
