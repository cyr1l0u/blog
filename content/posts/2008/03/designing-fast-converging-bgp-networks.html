Wrong! When Cisco's engineers fixed the IOS BGP code, they dramatically improved BGP's response times. In the March <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article, <em><a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/DesigningBGPNetworks/">Designing Fast Converging BGP Networks</a></em>, I'm describing one of the new features, the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/gt_bsfda.html">BGP fast peering session deactivation</a>, including in-depth description of how it works, design guidelines and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_4t/12_4t4/ht_bgpsn.html">recently added options</a> that are not well explained in Cisco's documentation (one of the features is so new it's been working properly only since 12.4(15)T3).
