I've tried to port a simple Tcl full-screen editor to IOS and failed completely as IOS <strong>tclsh</strong> escapes control characters written by the <strong>puts</strong> command. For example, the following escape sequence should clear the screen, but as the ESCAPE character is displayed as ^[, it doesn't work:<pre class="code">router(tcl)#puts "\033\[2J"<br/>^[[2J<br/>router(tcl)#</pre>Any ideas how to persuade the router to display raw binary data?
