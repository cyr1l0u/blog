At the time I found the argument interesting, but a bit academic. <br/><br/>A few months later, I've experienced interesting routing flaps in one of my lab setups. A detailed investigation revealed that they were caused by Area Border Routers redistributing inter-area information back into the area from which it originated, effectively creating a temporary routing black hole. You can find the details, in-depth explanation as well as workaround solutions in my february <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/OSPFDistanceVector/">When OSPF Becomes a Distance Vector Protocol</a>.
