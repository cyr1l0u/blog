The various models you can use to run OSPF over partially-meshed WAN (usually Frame Relay) are complex enough to make you scream ... or switch to EIGRP :) Arden Packeer did an excellent job in his three-part tutorial describing <a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/routing-protocols/tutorial-ospf-network-types-and-frame-relay-part-1/">broadcast and non-broadcast network types</a>, <a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/routing-protocols/tutorial-ospf-network-types-and-frame-relay-part-2/">point-to-multipoint network type</a> and <a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/routing-protocols/tutorial-ospf-network-types-and-frame-relay-part-3/">point-to-point links over Frame Relay</a>.<p class="info">If you still have problems with OSPF after reading all three tutorials, use point-to-point subinterfaces.</p>
