<p>I wanted to write about BFD a year ago when it was first advertised as being available in the low-end routers (BFD support on high-end platforms is much better, but I simply don’t have a GSR and a CRS-1 at home … yet), but it failed to work, so I had to shelve the idea until the IOS release 12.4(15)T matured to a point where BFD on ISR started working in IOS, not just in Powerpoint.</p>
<p>In this month’s IP corner article, “<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/bfd/">Improve the Convergence of Mission-Critical Networks with Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)</a>”, I’m describing BFD principles, its configuration on Cisco IOS and give you practical examples how you can use BFD to improve next-hop failure detection.</p>
