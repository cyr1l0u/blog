While that's no longer true, designing good BGP load balancing is still a complex undertaking. In the November <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article, <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/LoadBalancingBGP/"><em>Load Balancing in BGP Networks</em></a> I'm describing almost all options you have to implement BGP-based load balancing, both within your autonomous system as well as across an AS boundary.
