When I was testing the SMTP client on the routers (configured with <strong>action â€¦ mail</strong> command or as part of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6017/products_feature_guide_chapter09186a00804d343f.html#wp1219998">EEM SMTP library</a>), I didn't want the messages with weird addresses and content to circulate through our e-mail system (plus I wanted to see the results immediately), so I wrote a simple SMTP server in Perl that prints the messages it receives. It accepts a single parameter: the IP address to listen on (only needed on workstations with multiple IP addresses). <p class="note">You need the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~macgyver/SMTP-Server-1.1/Server.pm">Net::SMTP::Server</a> module on top of the standard Perl distribution to make it work.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Simple_SMTP_server_in_PERL">download the PERL source code</a> or <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Media:SmtpDump.zip">compiled EXE file (for Windows users)</a> from <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</p>
