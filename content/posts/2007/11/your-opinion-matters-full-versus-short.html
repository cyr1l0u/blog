I don't mind people quoting me (even larger passages of my text) as long as the proper credits appear somewhere in the post, but straight copy from my blog feed is too much.<br/><br/>Obviously, the easy stopgap measure would be to change the feed format from full to short, which would only pass the first few lines of every blog post into the feed, resulting in a bit more effort on your end, as you'd have to click on the post link in the feed reader to view the whole text. Would this be a major nuisance for anyone?
