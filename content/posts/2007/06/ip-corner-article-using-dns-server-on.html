The answer is very simple: I was doing research for my June <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article, <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/RouterDNS/">Cisco Router: the Swiss Army Knife of Network Services</a>, where you'll find in-depth explanation of what Cisco IOS DNS server can and cannot do, as well as several usage scenarios (including a tip on how to stop unwanted browser ads).
