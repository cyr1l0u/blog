I've been considering adding the <a href="www.digg.com">Digg-it</a> button to my blog for a while, but never found time to do it properly ... until a rainy quiet Saturday morning when I've stumbled across <a href="http://www.cashquests.com/2007/03/hacking-blogger-beta-adding-adsense.html">a great how-to article</a>. Excellent tip, but the digg-it text was displayed on white background which clashed horrendously with the dark-blue surroundings. So I finally gave up on using white text on dark background (which I sort-of fancy as I've started on old Digital VT100 terminals), hopefully also making the blog easier to read.
