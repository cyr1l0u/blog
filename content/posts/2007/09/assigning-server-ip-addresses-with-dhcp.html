To start with, you have to define static DHCP mappings, which rely on client-id attribute in the DHCP request (usually the MAC address of the client). For me, the easiest way to find the correct client ID is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Use DHCP to assign the IP address to the server</li>
<li>Note the newly assigned IP address</li>
<li>Use the <strong>show ip dhcp bindings | include <em>ip-address</em></strong> command to display the client-id to IP address binding.</li>
<li>Create a static DHCP mapping (for example, by configuring a <strong>host</strong> DHCP pool on the router) and release/renew IP address on the server</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if the Ethernet adapter in the server is replaced, the static mapping stops working. The only reliable workaround I've found so far is to assign a locally-administered MAC address to the server's LAN adapter (if anyone has figured out a way to assign ASCII client-ID to a Windows server, let me know). To do it on Windows XP, use the Advanced properties in the adapter configuration window.</p>

<p class="note"><span>Remember: </span>locally-administered MAC addresses on Ethernet networks start with 02xx.</p>
<p>After you've configured MAC address on the server, prepend 01 to it and insert a dot after every fourth character to get the client-ID you need to enter on the DHCP server. For example, the MAC address 0200.1000.1234 becomes client-id 0102.0010.0012.34, and the static DHCP pool on a router is configured as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">ip dhcp pool Server_static<br/>host 10.0.0.10 255.255.255.0<br/>client-identifier 0102.0010.0012.34</pre>
