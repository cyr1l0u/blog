While this option is totally harmless on the point-to-point serial links that I was using, one of the readers experienced hard-to-diagnose problems on upstream LAN interfaces that disappeared when we've removed the <strong>name</strong> option from the configuration.</p>
<p>As the solution presented in the article does not need the <strong>name</strong> option to differentiate between the static routes (the <strong>track</strong> keyword is enough to make a difference), it should be removed (and we've already removed it from the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SmallSiteMultiHoming/">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.nil.com/C125726f00447899/html/SmallSiteMultiHomingPDF/$FILE/IPC_0207_SmallSiteMultiHoming.pdf">PDF</a> version of the article).</p>
<p class='update'>Update: It turned out the problems my reader experienced had nothing to do with the <strong>name</strong> option of the <strong>ip route</strong> command, but the generic advice still applies: don't use the features you don't need.</p>
