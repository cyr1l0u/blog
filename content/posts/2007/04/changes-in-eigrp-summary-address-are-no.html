Earlier IOS versions treated changes in EIGRP summary address configuration (configured with the <strong>ip summary-address eigrp</strong> interface configuration command) very disruptively: all EIGRP sessions across the affected interface were cleared, sometimes resulting in a large number of routes entering <em>active</em> state, potentially leading to a <em>stuck-in-active</em> condition.<br/><br/>Recent IOS releases are more lenient: router with a change in summary address requests a resync (logged as graceful-restart on adjacent routers). A lot of updates and queries are still sent, but the adjacencies themselves are preserved:<ul><li>When configuring a summary route, all more specific prefixes on downstream routers enter <em>active</em> state.</li>
<li>When a summary is removed, only the summary prefix itself enters <em>active</em> state and the affected router sends queries to all its neighbors, while the more specific prefixes are sent as regular EIGRP updates to the neighbors across the affected interface.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->A change in EIGRP summary generates the following output on the router under configuration:<blockquote class="code">a1(config)#<strong>interface serial 0/0/0.100</strong><br/>a1(config-subif)#<strong>ip summary-address eigrp 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0</strong><br/>%DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: IP-EIGRP(0) 1: Neighbor 172.16.1.2 (Serial0/0/0.100) is resync: summary configured<br/>a1(config-subif)#<strong>no ip summary-address eigrp 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0</strong><br/>%DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: IP-EIGRP(0) 1: Neighbor 172.16.1.2 (Serial0/0/0.100) is resync: summary configured</blockquote>
... and the downstream router generates log messages similar to these:<blockquote class="code">b1#<br/>%DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: IP-EIGRP(0) 1: Neighbor 172.16.1.1 (Serial0/0/0.100) is resync: peer graceful-restart</blockquote>
