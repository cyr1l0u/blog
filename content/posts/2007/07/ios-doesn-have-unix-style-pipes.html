<p>Recently one of my readers asked an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class='cite'>&ldquo;It looks like the second pipe character (&brvbar;) in an output filter is interpreted as an OR, not as yet another filter. How can I thus implement a filter that will match string_a AND string_b?</blockquote>
<p>As explained in my IP Corner article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/EnhanceIOSUI/">Enhance the IOS user interface</a>, the output filters are extensions of the show command. The first &brvbar; character starts the filter specification and anything after the first keyword is part of a regular expression (where &brvbar; means <em>or</em>).</p>
<p>To match a combination of two strings, you could either write a small Tcl script or use a more convoluted regular expression where you combine both strings into a single expression (inserting .* between them to match any intermediate set of characters). For example, to find all static host routes in your router configuration, you could use the following filter:<pre class='code'>show running | include ip route.*255\.255\.255\.255</pre><p class='note'><strong>Note: </strong>The \. matches the dot character, whereas the . matches anything.</p>
