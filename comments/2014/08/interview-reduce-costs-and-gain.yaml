    html: True, I agree it&#39;s mostly a process constraint, getting approvals, sign
      offs, keying in POs and work breakdown structures into SAP, etc ... Then there
      I are the ITIL like change mgmt hurdles and hoops to jump through and then the
      customer coordination. I don&#39;t think SDN will reduce timelines significantly
      but where it might bring value is in eliminating errors, self/auto-documentation
      and determinism over traffic

  html: '&quot;In a typical enterprise data center it might take a few days to implement
    a new firewall or load balancing rule, and a few weeks to deploy a new application.&quot;<br
    /><br />...which is usually coming from the change process, enforced by the customer(s)
    and/or business lines. In this case, an orchestrator with a web based GUI would
    shorten the few days with a few minutes, not reduce the few days to a few minutes.
