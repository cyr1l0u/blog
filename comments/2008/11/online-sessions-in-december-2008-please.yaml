  html: Hi there,<BR/><BR/>Sorry if I miss this in some older post, but how this sessions
    will take place? We need some aditional software (like webex for example) or just
    an internet browser?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!

  html: You haven't missed anything. I don't know yet what platform I'll use; for
    the moment I could choose between Webex and Placeware. In any case, all you'll
    need will be a browser (and maybe zillion of downloadable ActiveX files :).

  html: I am pleased to see others have the same issues with dynamic routing and firewalls.  There
    is shared solace in numbers!
