            <p class="comment-content">If I&#39;m not mistaken, some existing merchant ASICs support only a single VXLAN VNI per bridge table and require/enforce these on both ingress and egress tunnels for L2.  At a minimum it&#39;s a limitation of the SDK for these chips.  The reason, as I understand it, is that these chips were developed for multicast-based flood-and-learn VXLAN which mandates global VXLAN VNI.  EVPN implementations have had this to contend with on these chips even though EVPN doesn&#39;t really care what the VNIs for a VPN are are so long as they represent the correct bridge table contexts that make up the VPN (as we see with EVPN MPLS).  With newer merchant ASICs I think locally significant VXLAN VNI for bridge tables are possible.</p>
