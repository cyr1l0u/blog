            <p class="comment-content">This is why I love networking &quot;visioners&quot;. One day the tell you how we will all program every single flow from magic controller. Next day they tell you to run BGP with EVPN on every pizza box.<br /><br />By the way, what is &quot;open&quot; about it? Did they make Broadcom SDK public?</p>
