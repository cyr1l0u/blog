            <p class="comment-content">Hi Ivan <br /><br />We have three different types of workloads in our environment such as Compute, Caching and Storage. <br /><br />We have three different infras for our set up. There is a caveat which you have mentioned in earlier posts that sharing Compute and caching workloads brings us the QOS mapping issues and also burstiness seems to be a issue with different buffer sizes required and shares same fate. Do you throw some more light to it or do you have any whitepaper associated to it. </p>
